It is an\nancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives\nof this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of\nan unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are\ncarried out by entirely natural means.\nAccording to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body\u2019s three\nfundamental energies, or \ndoshas (vata, pitta, kapha)\n and an equally vital balance among\nbody, mind, and the soul or consciousness.\nAyurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and\nrelates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of\nhealing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction\nand relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health,\nAyurveda takes into consideration these di\u0283erent levels of life and their\ninterconnectedness.\nAs a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle,\nexercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along\nwith cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous\nadjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The\npurpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the\nlifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to\ncreate, maintain, or restore health and balance.\nAyurveda\n is a Sanskrit word that means \u201cthe science of life and longevity.\u201d According\nto this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique\nphenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution,\nwhich is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this\nindividual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water,\nand Earth.\nThese \u0279ve elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or \ndoshas\n. Ether\nand air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; \u0279re and water constitute\npitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy;\nand water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the\nmale sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha\nfactors from the parents\u2019 bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment,\ndue to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship,\nform a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2748, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4ecf47d-58fe-4bf2-a273-b71cf14ceff2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4ecf47d-58fe-4bf2-a273-b71cf14ceff2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72cf6c59-c803-4bdb-826d-150e28d946d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "ed2be825cfb5ae361eeb2144d192530a3b3a32d7df7b2393b8c5f345056eb7fb"}}, "hash": "ed2be825cfb5ae361eeb2144d192530a3b3a32d7df7b2393b8c5f345056eb7fb", "text": "In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic\ncode; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our \nprakruti\n or individual constitution, a\nconstant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of\nenergy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and\npredispositions.\nThough the underlying structure of our \nprakruti\n remains a fixed reality, our home base\nor essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in\nage and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our\nendlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the\nfood we eat continuously a\u0283ect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insu\u027dcient rest or\nexercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our \ndoshic\n balance. Depending on the type\nof changes and the individual\u2019s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:\n\u2022 Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to\nconditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as\nattachment, greed, and possessiveness.\n\u2022 A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may\ndevelop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery,\nhives, rash, or acne.\n\u2022 Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica,\narthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and\ninsecurity.\nAll these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to\nhuman su\u0283ering, are due to alterations in the body\u2019s inner ecology. These upset the\nindividual\u2019s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease.\nThis is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every\nindividual in every walk of life.\nAs the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain\nhealthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this\nadjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with\nwhich our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.\nTo maintain health and balance, we have \nto juggle with the three doshas, taking\naction to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand.

Simply stated, that purpose is to know\nor realize the Creator (Cosmic Consciousness) and to understand our relationship with\nThat, which will entirely in\u027buence our daily living. This great purpose is to be achieved\nby balancing four fundamental aspects of life: \ndharma\n, which is duty or right action;\nartha\n, material success or wealth; \nkama\n, positive desire; and \nmoksha\n, spiritual liberation.\nThese are called the four \npurusharthas\n, the four great aims or achievements in the life of\nany individual.\nThe foundation of all these facets of life is health. To maintain \ndharma\n and carry out\nour duties and responsibilities to ourselves and others, we must be healthy. Likewise, in\norder to create a\u0280uence and achieve success in action, good health is indispensable. To\nhave creative, positive desire, we need a healthy mind and consciousness, a healthy\nbody, and healthy perception. (Desire\u2014\nkama\n\u2014is sometimes translated as sex and refers\nto progeny and family life, but it is really the positive energy or force of desire that\ngenerates and propels any creative work.) And \nmoksha\n or spiritual liberation is nothing\nbut perfect harmony of body, mind, and consciousness or soul. Thus the whole possibility\nof achievement and fulfillment in life rests on good health.\nIn the quarter century that I have been practicing medicine, I have worked in\nsurgery, gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics, as well as in general medicine, treating\nthousands of individuals in all stages and walks of life. I have repeatedly observed that\nlifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, and daily routine, can be a potent source of\nhealing as well as a cause of disease. Many health problems seem intertwined with the\nstresses of daily life, family and relationship problems, and worries about job and\nmoney. Others are directly connected to eating the wrong kinds of food or getting too\nmuch or too little exercise.\nI have also grown more and more aware that illness provides us with an invitation\nfor self-transformation, an opportunity to change our way of thinking, feeling, eating,\nand in general caring for ourselves and our lives.

Both \nPurusha\n and \nPrakruti\n are eternal, timeless, and\nimmeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every\nman and woman, as well as inanimate objects.\nPurusha\n is formless and beyond attributes. Unmanifested pure existence, beyond\ncause and e\u0283ect, beyond space and time, \nPurusha\n takes no active part in creation but\nremains a silent witness.\nPrakruti\n, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances\nthe dance of creation. \nPrakruti\n is the One that becomes many. \nPurusha\n is the lover,\nPrakruti\n the beloved. Creation of this universe happens through their love. All of nature\nis the child born from the womb of \nPrakruti\n, the Divine Mother.\nIn the manifestation of nature from \nPrakruti\n, the \u0279rst expression is \nMahad\n (or \nMahat\n),\nintelligence or cosmic order. (In human beings, it is referred to as \nBuddhi\n, intellect.) Next\nis \nAhamkar\n or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which\nwe think, act, and react. \nAhamkar\n expresses itself in three universal qualities:\nSattva\n is stability, purity, wakefulness, essence, clarity, and light.\nRajas\n is dynamic movement and causes sensations, feelings, and emotions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2501, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e547849-abba-4a9a-be00-b611626fb28e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e547849-abba-4a9a-be00-b611626fb28e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b57681a-f0a0-463e-bd25-0b90bad83474", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "0a94efc7b9e11296c2bdad99cc5d45dfa5101cf4712b47e7aa71406daed14db8"}}, "hash": "0a94efc7b9e11296c2bdad99cc5d45dfa5101cf4712b47e7aa71406daed14db8", "text": "Tamas\n is the tendency toward inertia, darkness, ignorance, and heaviness. \nTamas\n is\nresponsible for deep sleep and periods of confusion.

Fire is active and\nchangeable. In our solar system, the sun is the source of \u0279re and light.

Water exists in the body as plasma, cytoplasm, serum,\nsaliva, nasal secretion, cerebrospinal \u027buid, urine, and sweat. It is necessary for nutrition\nand to maintain life; without it, our cells could not survive. Water is contentment, love,\nand compassion.

We use fire to prepare food (made of water and earth).\nThe Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha\nThese \u0279ve great elements combine into three basic energies or functional principles,\nwhich are present, in varying degrees, in everything and everybody. Space (ether) and\nair constitute vata. Fire and water combine to make up pitta. Water and earth constitute\nkapha.\nIn our bodies, these three doshas or humors govern our psychobiological functioning.\nvata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they\ncreate health. When out of balance, they are the cause of disease.\nThese three doshas are responsible for the huge variety of individual di\u0283erences and\npreferences, and they in\u027buence all we are and all we do, from our choices of food to our\nmodes of relating to others. They govern the biological and psychological processes of\nour body, mind, and consciousness. They regulate the creation, maintenance, and\ndestruction of bodily tissue, and the elimination of waste products. They also govern our\nemotions. When in balance, they generate noble qualities such as understanding,\ncompassion, and love. When their balance is disturbed by stress, improper diet,\nenvironmental conditions or other factors, they can give rise to negative emotions such\nas anger, fear, and greed.\nIn Ayurveda, vata is the bodily air principle. It is the energy of movement. Pitta is\nthe principle of \u0279re, the energy of digestion and metabolism. And kapha is the principle\nof water, the energy of lubrication and structure.\nAll people have all of these three doshas, but one of them is usually primary, one\nsecondary, and the third least prominent. Thus, each person has a particular pattern of\nenergy, an individual combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics\nthat make up his or her constitution (\nprakruti\n).

Prana\n is the pure\nessence of vata. It is the life-force, the play of intelligence. That \u027bow of intelligence is\nnecessary for communication between two cells, and it maintains the life function of\nboth. On a cosmic level, \nprana\n is said to be the attraction between \nPurusha\n and \nPrakruti\n.\nAs the principle of mobility, vata regulates all activity in the body, both mental and\nphysiological. It is responsible for breathing, the blinking of our eyes, the beating of our\nhearts, and all movement in the cytoplasm and cell membranes. All the impulses in the\nvast networks of our nervous system are governed by vata.\nWhen vata is in balance, it promotes creativity and \u027bexibility and evokes feelings of\nfreshness, lightness, happiness, and joy. Out of balance, vata produces fear,\nnervousness, anxiety, even tremors and spasms.\nVata is dry, light, cold, subtle, clear, mobile, and dispersing. We shall soon see how\nthese qualities are expressed in a person with a vata constitution.\nPITTA\nPitta is translated as \u0279re, but this is not meant literally. Rather, it is the \nprinciple\n of\n\u0279re, the energy of heating or metabolism. Pitta governs all the biochemical changes that\ntake place within our bodies, regulating digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body\ntemperature. From the standpoint of modern biology, pitta comprises the enzymes and\namino acids that play a major role in metabolism.\nPitta regulates body temperature through the chemical transformation of food.

Every impression coming in from the outside is\nalso processed or \u201cdigested\u201d and made a part of us. Thus pitta (when in balance)\npromotes intelligence and understanding and is crucial \nin learning. Out-of-balance pitta\nmay arouse fiery emotions such as frustration, anger, hatred, criticism, and jealousy.\nPitta is hot, sharp, light, oily, liquid, pungent, sour, and spreading. These qualities\noccur in various ways in people of pitta constitution.\nKAPHA\nKapha combines water and earth. It is the energy that forms the body\u2019s structure, the\nglue that holds the cells together. Kapha also supplies the liquid needed for the life of\nour cells and bodily systems. It lubricates our joints, moisturizes the skin, helps to heal\nwounds, and maintains immunity. Kapha provides strength, vigor, and stability.\nPsychologically, excess kapha is responsible for the emotions of attachment, greed,\nlust, and envy. When kapha is in balance it expresses itself in tendencies toward love,\ncalmness, and forgiveness.\nThe qualities of kapha include heavy, slow, cool, oily, damp, smooth, soft, static,\nviscous, and sweet. Kapha individuals display these qualities in various ways.\nTogether, these three doshas govern all the body\u2019s metabolic activities. Kapha\npromotes anabolism, the process of building up the body, the growth and creation of\nnew cells as well as cell repair. Pitta regulates metabolism, which is digestion and\nabsorption. Vata triggers catabolism, the necessary deterioration process in which larger\nmolecules are broken down into smaller ones.\nVata, the principle of movement, moves both pitta and kapha, which are immobile.\nThus when vata is out of balance, it in\u027buences and disturbs the other doshas. The\nmajority of illnesses have aggravated vata at their source.\nThe whole of life\u2019s journey is divided into three major milestones. From birth to age\n16 is the kapha age. From 16 to 50 is the age of pitta, and from 50 to 100 the age of\nvata.\nIn childhood, kapha and the process of anabolism are predominant, as this is the\ntime of greatest physical growth and the structuring of the body. Kapha disorders, such\nas lung congestion, cough, colds, and mucus secretions, are common at this time. In\nadulthood, a time of activity and vitality, pitta is most apparent. Vata and the catabolic\nprocesses of deterioration take over in old age, bringing vata disorders such as tremors,\nemaciation, breathlessness, arthritis, and loss of memory.\nThe Twenty Qualities: An Important Key to Healing", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2557, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b34b7f1-d732-4602-a01f-fbd886ae661b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b34b7f1-d732-4602-a01f-fbd886ae661b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "43cdbc6f-5aa9-4319-b777-b0cad027acf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "2332473c16c7a3c403232b72036195edc529fc54dfee8eb7a19440e38abc3fb4"}}, "hash": "2332473c16c7a3c403232b72036195edc529fc54dfee8eb7a19440e38abc3fb4", "text": "Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you\nto make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental\nqualities, which appear in ten pairs:\nThe Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities\nHeavy\u2014Light\nOily\u2014Dry\nStable\u2014Mobile\nSlimy\u2014Rough\nGross\u2014Subtle\nCold\u2014Hot\nSlow\u2014Sharp\nSoft\u2014Hard\nDense\u2014Liquid\nCloudy\u2014Clear\nThese qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today\u2019s\nweather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable,\nhot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice\ncream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry,\nrough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking\nmay be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or\ncloudy.\nWe are constantly a\u0283ected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry\nweather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments\nsuch as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and\nmay lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne,\neczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha,\nleading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and\nweight gain.\nEach of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two\nqualities in each pair in\u027buence or a\u0283ect one another according to two fundamental\nprinciples of Ayurveda:\n1. Like increases like.\n2.

These simple\nremedies immediately make sense when we hear them because they are so natural.\nAyurvedic physicians have carefully observed nature and located these qualities\nwithin all things, both organic and inorganic. Ayurvedic treatment consists to a great\nextent of identifying a person\u2019s disorder in terms of these qualities, and setting right any\nimbalances.\nHow is this done? Speaking in very general terms, excessive dryness in the body\u2014\nconstipation, dry skin, emaciation, and so on\u2014is frequently associated with aggravated\nvata; excessive heat\u2014burning urine, irritated eyes, fever, in\u027bammation, anger, or a\ncritical attitude\u2014with aggravated pitta; and undue heaviness\u2014lethargy, overweight,\ncongestion, and excess mucus\u2014with unbalanced kapha.

Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals,\nwill have ten di\u0283erent temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics.\nMaintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our\nchallenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is\ngood, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.\nPrakruti and Vikruti\nAt the time of conception, each person\u2019s combination and proportion of vata, pitta,\nand kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions\nof the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents\ncombine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.\nIf, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant,\nand the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot\nsummer \nnight after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a\nconstitution that is pitta predominant.

Your \nprakruti\n may, for example, be predominantly\npitta, with vata secondary and a little kapha. (This can be written as V\n2\nP\n3\nK\n1\n.) For you,\nmaintaining balance means keeping this proportion. If your vata or kapha should\nincrease, moving toward an equal proportion of the doshas, it would not be healthy for\nyou.\nAs conditions change\u2014due to weather, dietary choices, fatigue, stress, emotional\nstate, exercise or lack of it\u2014the balance of the doshas in our mind-body system also\nchanges. This altered state of the doshas, re\u027becting the current state of our health, is\ncalled our \nvikruti\n. If your health is excellent, your current doshic status will be the same\nas your \nprakruti\n. But more likely there will be a discrepancy, and it is this di\u0283erence\nbetween the two that gives a direction for healing. Your aim will be to reestablish the\nbalance indicated by your \nprakruti\n.\nI know you are eager to \u0279nd out what your constitution is, so let\u2019s move on to that.\nAfterward, we will look more deeply into the characteristics of each doshic type.\nHow to Determine Your Constitutional Type\nThe chart on \nthis page\n to \nthis page\n is a self-assessment that will enable you to\ndetermine your unique constitution according to Ayurveda.\nPlease remember that this can provide only a rough guideline. The subtleties of each\nperson\u2019s mental, emotional, and physical makeup are manifold and can be accurately\nassessed only by a physician thoroughly trained and experienced in Ayurvedic diagnosis.\nSo please do not draw any absolute conclusions about yourself based on the self-\nassessment or the descriptions of the doshas; rather, use this information to help you\ngrow in self-understanding, and as a guide to plan your diet, exercise regimen, and\nother aspects of your lifestyle for maximum health.\nIt is best to \u0279ll out the self-evaluation twice. (You might want to photocopy it, to\nhave it available for others or for future use.) First, base your choices on what is most\nconsistently \ntrue about your life as a whole, over many years. This indicates your\nprakruti\n. Then \u0279ll it out a second time, considering how you have been feeling recently,\nin the last month or two. This is your \nvikruti\n or present condition.\nIt often helps to have a spouse or good friend verify your answers, as they may have\ngood insights and some objectivity to offer as you make your responses.\nAfter \u0279lling out the chart, add up the number of marks under vata, pitta, and kapha", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2893, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f29a037-d5ed-4252-8404-3cc5cbb3dd23": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f29a037-d5ed-4252-8404-3cc5cbb3dd23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f975d1b3-add3-4f84-8e7c-aaa14dfc1327", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "69430c83b8d1069dddeab71c03bc6cee91b59fb8c38288a4d9ca9085a1a46bfa"}}, "hash": "69430c83b8d1069dddeab71c03bc6cee91b59fb8c38288a4d9ca9085a1a46bfa", "text": "to discover your own balance of the doshas in your \nprakruti\n and \nvikruti\n. Most people will\nhave one dosha predominant, a few will have two doshas approximately equal, and\neven fewer will have all three doshas in equal proportion.\nAfter adding up the numbers, make them into a ratio, with 3 as the highest number.\nFor example, suppose you come out with V = 10, P = 6, K = 3. This would translate\ninto V\n3\nP\n2\nK\n1\n.\nOnce you have determined your predominant doshas, studying the following\ncharacteristics of vata, pitta, and kapha will help you gain a deeper and more\ncomprehensive understanding.\nCharacteristics of the Vata Individual\nVata individuals have light, \u027bexible bodies. Their frame is on the small side, with\nlight muscles and little fat, so that they tend to be slim or even underweight. They often\nappear to be \u201ctoo tall\u201d or \u201ctoo short,\u201d or they may appear physically underdeveloped,\nwith \u027bat chests and less strength and stamina than the other types. Their veins and\nmuscles are often quite prominent.\nVatas generally have dry skin tending toward roughness. Their circulation is poor,\nwith the result that their hands and feet are often cold. Because vata dosha is cold, dry,\nlight, and mobile and people with a vata constitution tend to lack insulating material\n(the fatty tissue under the skin), they are uncomfortable in cold weather, especially if it\nis dry and windy, and they much prefer spring and summer.\nThese individuals have a variable appetite and thirst and variable digestive strength.\nThey are often attracted to astringent food such as salads and vegetables, but their\nbodies actually need sweet, sour, and salty tastes. (We will discuss the e\u0283ect of tastes in\nchapter 8\n.) Raw vegetables increase, rather than balance, vata. Vata individuals often\nexperience digestive di\u027dculties and problems with absorption of nutrients. They tend to\nproduce scanty urine, and their feces are hard, dry, and small in size and quantity.\nConstipation is one of their most common ailments.\nVatas are the most likely of the body types to fast or to eat very little, but this\nactually increases vata and tends toward imbalance.\nOther physical characteristics typical of vata types include small, recessed eyes,\nwhich are often quite lusterless; dry, thin hair, often curly or kinky; dry, rough skin and\nnails; cracking, popping joints; and teeth that may be irregular, broken, or protruding.\nVatas walk quickly and are always in a rush. Due to the mobile quality of vata, they\ndo not like sitting idle but prefer constant activity. They also like to do a lot of\ntraveling. Not doing anything is a punishment for them. They are attracted to jogging,\njumping, and vigorous physical activity, but because they tend to have less stamina,\nthey can easily get strained or overtired.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2788, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e43426f-2ac4-4784-bbd8-8350f08b2040": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e43426f-2ac4-4784-bbd8-8350f08b2040", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "518428f4-8ba4-4336-8504-a5cc60cf8ced", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "108aaebe041467b7d1d43c68ba16359855736d7e922cf7db70ae32a083a2e9a0"}}, "hash": "108aaebe041467b7d1d43c68ba16359855736d7e922cf7db70ae32a083a2e9a0", "text": "Vatas are drawn toward a lot of sexual activity.

Vatas may be low on\nwillpower and often feel unstable or ungrounded.\nClarity is one of the attributes of vata, and vata individuals generally are clear-\nminded and even clairvoyant.

Nerve disorders, twitches and\ntics, mental confusion, palpitations, and breathlessness, as well as muscle tightness, low\nbackache, and sciatica, are also due to aggravated vata. Excess vata makes the mind\nrestless and hyperactive. Loud noises, drugs, sugar, ca\u0283eine, and alcohol also derange\nvata dosha, as does exposure to cold weather and cold foods.\nThe Attributes of Vata Individuals\nFollowing are the main attributes of vata dosha and how they are expressed in\nthe physical, mental, and behavioral characteristics of a vata individual.\nATTRIBUTES\nMANIFESTATIONS IN THE BODY\nDry\nDry skin, hair, lips, tongue; dry colon, tending toward constipation;\nhoarse voice\nLight\nLight muscles, bones, thin body frame, light scanty sleep;\nunderweight\nCold\nCold hands, feet, poor circulation; hates cold and loves hot; stiffness", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2576, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fef28820-5136-4585-b28a-318c0aeeb3b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "fef28820-5136-4585-b28a-318c0aeeb3b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ede2a752-0918-4ac5-8a44-d8b3e7658817", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "32157487332bf6e7ad48e2ff1596e20a3b2af03baa097afe3df87427d28d28d0"}}, "hash": "32157487332bf6e7ad48e2ff1596e20a3b2af03baa097afe3df87427d28d28d0", "text": "of muscles\nRough\nRough, cracked skin, nails, hair, teeth, hands and feet; cracking\njoints\nSubtle\nSubtle fear, anxiety, insecurity; fine goose pimples; minute muscle\ntwitching, fine tremors; delicate body\nMobile\nFast walking, talking, doing many things at a time; restless eyes,\neyebrows, hands, feet; unstable joints; many dreams; loves traveling\nbut does not stay at one place; swinging moods and shaky faith\nClear\nClairvoyant; understands and forgets immediately; clear, open mind,\nexperiences void and loneliness\nAstringent\nDry choking sensation in the throat; gets hiccoughs, burping; loves\noily, mushy soups; craving for sweet, sour, and salty tastes\nExcess vata is a major factor in PMS (premenstrual syndrome).

They seldom gain or lose much weight. Their muscle\ndevelopment is moderate, and they are generally stronger physically than vata types.\nPitta eyes are bright and may be gray, green, or copper-brown, and their eyeballs are of\nmedium prominence. These individuals tend to have ruddy or coppery skin and may\nhave reddish hair, which tends to be silky. They often experience early graying or hair\nloss, so that a pitta man frequently has a receding hairline or a big, beautiful bald head!\nMoles and freckles are common on pitta skin, which tends to be oily, warm, and less\nwrinkled than vata skin. Pittas have sharp, slightly yellowish teeth and frequently have\nbleeding gums.\nThe normal body temperature of people with a pitta constitution is a little higher,\nand their hands and feet are usually warm and may be sweaty. Pittas may feel quite\nwarm when both vatas and kaphas are cold. They perspire quite a lot, even when it\u2019s 50\ndegrees, while a vata person will not perspire even at a much higher temperature. Their\nbody perspiration often has a strong, sulfury smell; their feet also perspire and may\nhave a strong smell.\nThis heat is the main characteristic of pitta types, which is not surprising as the word\npitta is derived from the Sanskrit word \ntapa\n, which means to heat. (The word can also be\ntranslated as \u201causterity,\u201d and pitta individuals can be quite austere.) They have a low\ntolerance for hot weather, sunshine, or hard physical work. Although they are a \u0279ery\ntype, their sex drive may not be very strong. Pittas may use sex to release anger.\nPittas have a strong appetite, strong metabolism, and strong digestion. They\nconsume large quantities of food and drink, and they also produce large quantities of\nurine and feces, which tend to be yellowish and soft. When out of balance, they crave\nhot spicy dishes, which are not good for them. They should eat food with the sweet,\nbitter, and astringent tastes. When hungry, a pitta person needs to eat soon, otherwise\nhe or she will become irritable and hypoglycemic.\nPitta sleep is of medium duration, but it is uninterrupted and sound. These\nindividuals like to read before they go to sleep and often fall asleep with a book on their\nchest.\nGirls with a pitta constitution begin menstruating and reach puberty early. They can\nstart menstruation as early as the age of ten.\nPitta physical ailments tend to be related to heat and the \u0279re principle. They are\nprone to fevers, in\u027bammatory diseases, acid indigestion, excessive hunger, jaundice,\nprofuse perspiration, hives and rashes, burning sensations, ulceration, burning eyes,\ncolitis, and sore throats. All \u201citises\u201d are in\u027bammatory disorders and are due to excess\npitta.

Their minds are always at work, and they like to solve\nproblems and puzzles of all kinds. They also tend to be good speakers. They are lovers of\nknowledge and have a great capacity for organization and leadership.\nPittas are night people. They become alert around midnight and love to read late at\nnight.\nOrderliness is important to them. A pitta person\u2019s home or room is always clean and\nneat. Clothes are kept in a designated place, shoes are in orderly rows, and books are\narranged according to height or another definite system.\nPittas love noble professions. They are doctors, engineers, lawyers, judges\u2014very\nbright, brainy people. They have good administrative abilities and like to be in a\nleadership role. They are good planners and are ambitious and disciplined. Aggressive\nby nature, they easily take charge of situations. They may become political \u0279gures. They\nhave a lot of charisma. People are attracted to them.\nPittas are often wise, brilliant people, but they can also have a controlling,\ndominating personality. They have a tendency toward comparison, competition, and\naggressiveness, and they are meticulous and perfectionistic. Everything has to be done\non time, and correctly! Pitta individuals never yield an inch from their principles, which\nsometimes leads to fanaticism. They tend to be critical, especially when pitta dosha is\naggravated; if there is no one to criticize, pitta people will criticize and judge\nthemselves.\nA pitta\u2019s life span is only moderately long. These individuals burn their life energy\nthrough too much mental activity, perfectionism, aggressiveness, and the constant\nsearch for success. They have a deep-seated fear of failure. They don\u2019t like the words \nno\nor \nfail\n and therefore may be highly stressful. They are the typical workaholics.\nPittas generally seek material prosperity and tend to be moderately well o\u0283, though\nthey spend rather than save their money. They like to live in luxurious homes and drive\nfancy cars; they love perfumes, gems, jewelry, and other costly items; and they enjoy\nexhibiting their wealth and possessions.\nA number of factors can increase pitta to the point of aggravation. One is simply\neating too much spicy food, including black pepper, cayenne pepper, curry peppers, and\njalape\u00f1o peppers. Pitta can also be increased by sour and citrus fruits, such as\ngrapefruits and sour oranges. Eating rancid yogurt, smoking cigarettes, and drinking\nsour wine can also be harmful.

By\nunderstanding your constitution, you can better understand your psychological\ntendencies, your strengths, and your weaknesses, as well as your physiological strong\nand weak areas.\n\u2022 You may see that your habits and tendencies, such as erratic lifestyle and schedule\n(vata)\n, irascibility \n(pitta)\n, or laziness \n(kapha)\n, or physical problems such as overweight\n(kapha)\n, ulcers \n(pitta)\n, or constipation \n(vata)\n, are directly related to your constitution.\nThe tendency toward such imbalances is inherent in the way your mind-body system is\ndesigned.\n\u2022 When you can anticipate the kinds of illnesses and imbalances you are likely to\nhave, you can take precautions to prevent them from arising. You can adjust your\nlifestyle\u2014daily routine, diet, amount or type of exercise, and so on\u2014to keep your\ndoshas in balance and your health at its best.\n\u2022 You can also use the knowledge of constitutional types to understand others with\nwhom you are related, whether in your personal life or at work. To succeed in\nrelationships, which is such a confused and problematic area today, it is helpful to know\nthe constitution of your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. Understanding one\nanother brings clarity; clarity brings compassion, and compassion is love. Such a\nrelationship brings happiness, joy, and longevity.\nUsing this knowledge of \nprakruti\n, if your spouse is upset and angry you can say to\nhim or her, \u201cHoney, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your pitta!\u201d That will open a new dimension of\nunderstanding of emotional reactions in the relationship.\nUse the knowledge of your \nprakruti\n as a baseline, to see where you should be. Then\nlook at your \nvikruti\n, your current imbalances, as a clue to help you restore balance, using\nthe food charts, yoga postures, herbs, recommended exercises, and the like, presented\nthroughout this book.\nFor instance, if your \nvikruti\n shows more pitta than your \nprakruti\n, you will want to\nfollow the guidelines for pacifying pitta. If you have a disorder that is caused by excess\nvata, pitta, or kapha, follow the guidelines for pacifying that dosha. For sinus\ncongestion, for example, follow a kapha-reducing diet until the condition subsides.\nIf your \nprakruti\n and \nvikruti\n seem about the same, then choose the diet and lifestyle\nguidelines for your strongest dosha.\nFinally, remember that \u201cbalance\u201d does not mean equal amounts of vata, pitta, and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2757, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1e784a1-f960-4c33-a258-4af3b5d9466d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1e784a1-f960-4c33-a258-4af3b5d9466d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5af3fa40-9916-4cbf-8967-22d55ce6b163", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "ffcda3785eeff171e3f821730560f0df27e2681507d97990968f733425876062"}}, "hash": "ffcda3785eeff171e3f821730560f0df27e2681507d97990968f733425876062", "text": "kapha; rather, it means maintaining \nyour proportion\n of the three doshas, according to\nyour constitution.

What is disease? Are sickness and health just a matter of luck,\nor of which bacteria you happen to encounter in your daily life? What can\nwe do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?\nThese are questions that the \u0279ve-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine\nhas considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of\npractical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.\nLet\u2019s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look\nat ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware\nof the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body\u2019s equilibrium and set\nthe disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally,\nwe will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest,\ninvisible stages until it is fully grown.\nThe Definition of Health\nAccording to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state\nof balance among body, mind, and consciousness.\nHealth consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven\ntissues \n(dhatus)\n, the three wastes \n(malas)\n, and the gastric \u0279re (agni), together\nwith the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.\nAlthough you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to\neffectively use the remedies in \nPart III\n, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger\npicture of the depth and practicality of this science.\nYou are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles\nthat govern all activity in the body: \nvata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta,\nthe energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and\nstructure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.\nThe \ndhatus\n are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of\nthe body and the functioning of the di\u0283erent organs and systems. Crucial to the\ndevelopment and nourishment of the body, the \ndhatus\n unfold successively as follows,\nstarting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:\n1\n. \nRasa\n (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2360, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46a2965e-bd65-4d59-a733-a9a80927e236": {"__data__": {"id_": "46a2965e-bd65-4d59-a733-a9a80927e236", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f07500c-ef39-4943-9d93-22e56e5bf532", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "42d638bdd1a0f253a21ddef5525d6bd63699e4ec46cdc3cdc9f2022b13dd981b"}}, "hash": "42d638bdd1a0f253a21ddef5525d6bd63699e4ec46cdc3cdc9f2022b13dd981b", "text": "nourishes all tissues, organs, and systems.\n2\n. \nRakta\n (blood) governs oxygenation in all tissues and vital organs and thus maintains\nlife-function.\n3\n. \nMamsa\n (muscle) covers the delicate vital organs, performs the movements of the\njoints, and maintains the physical strength of the body.\n4\n. \nMeda\n (fat) maintains the lubrication of the tissues and serves as insulating material\nto protect the body\u2019s heat.\n5\n. \nAsthi\n (bone and cartilage) gives support to the body\u2019s structure.\n6\n. \nMajja\n (bone marrow and nerves) \u0279lls up the bony spaces, carries motor and sensory\nimpulses, and facilitates communication among the body\u2019s cells and organs.\n7\n. \nShukra\n and \nartava\n (male and female reproductive tissues) contain the pure essence of\nall bodily tissues and can create a new life.\nEach \ndhatu\n is dependent on the previous one.

So for\ngood health, all seven \ndhatus\n must develop and function properly.\nThe three waste products \n(malas)\n are feces, urine, and sweat. The body must be able\nto produce these in appropriate amounts, and to eliminate them through their respective\nchannels.\nAgni is the biological \u0279re or heat energy that governs metabolism. It can be equated\nwith the digestive enzymes and metabolic processes involved in breaking down,\ndigesting, absorbing, and assimilating our food. Agni maintains the nutrition of the\ntissues and the strength of the immune system. It destroys microorganisms, foreign\nbacteria, and toxins in the stomach and intestines. It is an extremely vital factor in\nmaintaining good health.\nAgni sustains life and vitality. An individual endowed with adequate agni lives long\nand has excellent health. But when agni becomes impaired because of an imbalance in\nthe doshas, metabolism is adversely a\u0283ected. The body\u2019s resistance and immunity are\nimpaired, and the person begins to feel unwell. When this vital \u0279re is extinguished,\ndeath soon follows.\nIn addition to these bodily factors, the senses, mind, and spirit also play a vital role\nin maintaining good health, as we will discuss in the next section. When all these factors\nare balanced, it produces a state called \nswastha\n, which means \u201ctotally happy within\noneself.\u201d\nAgni\nThere is a saying in Ayurveda that a person is as old as his or her agni.\nAccording to the \nCharaka Samhita\n, one of the great classics of Ayurvedic medicine:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2543, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10fc7ac5-8e0d-4ae5-bfa1-f1434f045a7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "10fc7ac5-8e0d-4ae5-bfa1-f1434f045a7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c8cf833-d0ce-4cb7-893c-d92f6431401f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "4eaf2701a483b9915ca1095a449d56f76e6037b7c09acfef9f82d4a14f5197a7"}}, "hash": "4eaf2701a483b9915ca1095a449d56f76e6037b7c09acfef9f82d4a14f5197a7", "text": "\u201cThe span of life, health, immunity, energy, metabolism, complexion, strength,\nenthusiasm, luster, and the vital breath are all dependent on agni (bodily \u0279re).

The cause is like a seed, in which the as-yet-unmanifested tree\nis concealed. The tree is the expressed value of the seed. Health is the e\u0283ect of a healthy\nlifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the \u201ctree\u201d sprouted from unhealthy habits.\nAccording to the \nCharaka Samhita\n,\nBoth the patient and the patient\u2019s environment need to be examined in order\nto arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is\nimportant to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset\nof the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common\nlocal diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.\nThis enumeration opens the door to the wide variety of factors constantly in\u027buencing\nour health.

Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging,\njumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate\nvata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented\nfood, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating\ndairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.\nThe antidote to \u201clike increases like\u201d is \u201copposite qualities decrease or balance.\u201d This\nis the key to healing.\nNOTE\n: In general, one\u2019s \nprakruti\n indicates one\u2019s disease proneness. Individuals\nof pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not\ninevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks\nalcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will de\u0279nitely get\na pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy\nproducts and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to\ncongestive kapha disorders.\nFOOD AND DIET\nWe have already touched on the e\u0283ects of food on the doshas, and \nchapter 8\n will\ndiscuss this important topic in depth, so we won\u2019t go into it at length here. The principle\nis simply that eating the right kinds of food for your \nprakruti\n maintains vitality and\nbalance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the \u0279rst step in\nthe genesis of disease.\nEating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and\nacidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot a\u0283ord. For a vata individual, dried\nfruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke\nvata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a\nkapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods de\u0279nitely add to\nkapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking\ndiet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are de\u0279nitely creating\nimbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.\nWrong food combinations (see table \nthis page\n), stale food, food with chemical\nadditives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a\nrush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is\nthus one of the main potential causes of ill health\u2014but by understanding these\nprinciples and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also\none of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.\nSEASONS", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2773, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "503966a1-a001-4087-8f60-df875b842575": {"__data__": {"id_": "503966a1-a001-4087-8f60-df875b842575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59a279f3-afb4-47fa-a647-2f916b7ca405", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "3e79b53de71bc6de29d7a96dcb532c5e0296353a08020cff9f075ca57a8e0da2"}}, "hash": "3e79b53de71bc6de29d7a96dcb532c5e0296353a08020cff9f075ca57a8e0da2", "text": "Ayurveda classi\u0279es the seasons according to their predominant dosha. The windy,\ncool, dry weather of autumn is largely vata, followed \nby the dark, heavy, damp, cloudy\nkapha qualities of winter. Early spring is still primarily kapha, but as late spring arrives,\nthe increased warmth, light, and brightness express pitta qualities, which blossom in\ntheir full intensity in the summer.\nEach of these seasons brings its own challenges to health. The predominant dosha of\nthe season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in\nsomeone of the same \nprakruti\n. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and\naggravation.\nFor example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals\nwith a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold\nfood and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata\nillnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta\nindividuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need\nto keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the\nhot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to\navoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.\nWe will look further at the seasons, their e\u0283ects, and how we can best live in\nharmony with their rhythms and changes in \nchapter 5\n, where we discuss the ideal\nAyurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.\nEXERCISE\nExercise is another factor that can profoundly in\u027buence your health for better or\nworse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and\nimmunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is\nvital for e\u0283ective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins\nthrough sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of\ncalories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss. It also makes the\nmind alert and sharp and develops keen perception.\nOn the other hand, insu\u027dcient exercise, overexertion, or exercise that is\ninappropriate for one\u2019s constitution can lead to ill health.\nLack of exercise eventually brings a loss of \u027bexibility and strength and puts one at\ngreater risk for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart\ndisease.\nSome amount of sweating helps to eliminate toxins, reduces fat, and makes you feel\ngood. But overexertion may cause dehydration, breathlessness, chest pain, or muscle\naches, ultimately leading to arthritis, sciatica, or a heart condition.\nYoga stretching and some aerobic exercise are valuable for all body types, but the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2790, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cba8820-cadc-4246-b166-285ea12cff11": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cba8820-cadc-4246-b166-285ea12cff11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30303668-aee4-4e75-8371-064637905ab9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "0fae12ec6e8792be44755de6800d0bcd3d6cb8b8188baf5dcf8e99d98a951443"}}, "hash": "0fae12ec6e8792be44755de6800d0bcd3d6cb8b8188baf5dcf8e99d98a951443", "text": "amount and intensity of your exercise should be based upon your constitution.

Their bodies are soft and gentle (qualities of kapha),\nthey require more sleep than adults, and they are susceptible to kapha illnesses such as\ncolds and congestion.\nAdulthood exhibits more characteristics of pitta. Adults are more competitive,\naggressive, and ambitious than children; they work hard, they require less sleep, and\nthey fall prey to pitta-type disorders such as gastritis, colitis, and peptic ulcers.\nOld age is the age of vata. Elderly people sleep quite a bit less, and their sleep is\nbroken. They tend to get constipation, cracking and popping of joints, degenerative\ndiseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and su\u0283er from\nforgetfulness, all characteristic of vata dosha.\nThis shows that our age and stage of life are factors that have to be considered in the\nchoices we make to keep our doshas in balance and remain healthy. Elderly people, for\nexample, should not engage in strenuous exercise, and if possible they should minimize\ntravel, among many factors that increase vata. They should favor a vata-balancing diet,\nwith more warm, moist foods, more oil, and less salad and dried fruit.\nMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL FACTORS\nOur life is a whole, consisting of body, mind, and pure consciousness.

Because of\nthis, mind and body are never considered separately in Ayurveda.\nEvery perception, thought, feeling, and emotion, whether positive or negative, is a\nbiochemical event that in\u027buences the doshas and a\u0283ects the cells, tissues, and organs of\nthe body. Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions\ndisturb our doshic balance; likewise, when the doshas are already out of balance, they\nmay give rise to these same negative emotions.\n\u2022 Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, nervousness, restlessness,\nconfusion, grief, and sadness.\n\u2022 \nIncreased pitta\n is associated with anger, envy, hate, ambition, competitiveness,\ncriticism, judgmental attitude, sharp speech, perfectionism, and the need to be in\ncontrol.\n\u2022 \nIncreased kapha\n is associated with greed, attachment, possessiveness, boredom,\nlaziness, and lethargy.\nEmotions have an a\u027dnity with certain organs: grief and sadness with the lungs,\nanger with the liver, and hatred with the gall bladder. The kidneys may become the seat\nof fear, and the heart (as well as the lungs) the abode of grief and sadness. Nervousness\nis associated with the colon, while the stomach is the home of agitation and temptation,\nand the spleen may be related to attachment.\nAs we have discussed, emotions have a physical as well as a psychological aspect.\nEmotions are reactions to situations. If we do not understand and maintain clear\nawareness of the total movement of an emotion, from its arising to its dissolution, it will\ntend to adversely a\u0283ect a particular organ, causing stress and weakness and creating\nwhat is known as a \u201cdefective space\u201d (\nkhavaigunya\n), where a future disease may\nmanifest.

Kapha individuals under stress tend to eat and eat and eat.\nIn \nPart III\n you will \u0279nd many suggestions to minimize the impact of stress on your\nlife, and to relieve symptoms caused by stress if they develop.\nOVERUSE, UNDERUSE, AND WRONG USE OF THE SENSES\nOur senses give us great pleasure as well as vital information. Through ordinary\nexperience our senses of taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing can nourish us, and we\ncan also \u0279nd healing through sense therapies such as aromatherapy, color therapy,\nmantras and other healing sounds, massage, and the tastes in herbs and foods.\nBut because all our perceptions, as well as \nour thoughts and feelings, are biochemical\nevents as well as experiences in consciousness, improper use of the senses can create\nimbalance or damage in the body and result in illness.\nOveruse\n of the senses strains and stresses our nervous system. To use a simple\nexample, repeated exposure to bright light hurts the retina and strains the optic nerve,\nwhich triggers pitta, and sooner or later a person\u2019s eyesight will be a\u0283ected or neuritis-\nlike symptoms will arise. If we listen to loud music or hear loud sounds, the eardrum and\nthe rest of our hearing apparatus are hurt and weakened; if it occurs often, the person\ncan become deaf. Loud sounds also a\u0283ect systemic vata dosha, giving rise to vata\nsymptoms such as arthritis or degenerative changes in the bones. Lying in the sun strains\nthe sense of touch, aggravates pitta, and may lead to skin cancer.\nMisuse\n of the senses means using them in a wrong way, such as trying to read very\nsmall letters, or looking through a microscope or telescope (which creates a strain on the\neyes), or reading while lying down (which changes the angle of focus and builds up\nstress on the muscles of the eyeball), which will eventually result in pitta or vata\ndisorders. Eating a large quantity of wrong food, such as hot, spicy, stimulating food\ncontaining cayenne pepper, is a misuse of the taste organ. Listening to loud sounds over\nthe telephone, and long phone conversations, both aggravate vata. Exposing the senses\nto wrong inputs, such as watching violent movies on television, is also a misuse of the\nsenses.\nUnderuse\n of the senses means not perceiving with total attention, ignoring what we\nperceive, or not making full use of our wonderful sensory equipment. This can lead, for\nexample, to accidents. SAD (seasonal a\u0283ective disorder) is a form of depression that\na\u0283ects people who don\u2019t get enough sunlight during the winter\u2014a kind of underuse of\nthe sense of sight. \u201cCabin fever,\u201d the discomfort and restlessness born of staying indoors\nfor a long time, is at least partly the result of sensory deprivation.

We are related to the earth, the moon, the sun, the air we\nbreathe, the water we drink, the food we eat.

This is true even of such apparently\nuncontrollable factors as the seasons and the weather: if it is cold, you can dress\nwarmly; if it is hot, you can take it easy and stay out of the sun.\nHow Disease Develops\nAccording to Ayurveda, illness is the end result of a long process that can be detected\nand addressed at any stage. This process has been thoroughly studied and its phases\ndelineated in great detail.\nThe disease process begins with disturbances in the balance of the doshas. Temporary\nimbalances are common and quite normal; problems arise if the aggravated condition is\nnot corrected. In the normal course of events, vata, pitta, and kapha go through cycles\nof change in three stages: accumulation, provocation or aggravation, and paci\u0279cation.\nPitta, for example, begins to build up and accumulate in the late spring. It is provoked\nor aggravated in the hot summer months, and it naturally becomes paci\u0279ed when the\nweather cools down in the autumn.\nIf the increased dosha isn\u2019t paci\u0279ed naturally through a change in seasons, it\nundergoes further changes and disease may result. If a person with a predominantly\nvata constitution experiences some degree of increased vata in the fall due to the cool,\ndry, windy weather, but it returns to normal soon after, disease will not develop. The\nperson can aid the process of restoring balance, for example, by eating moist, warming\nfoods and dressing warmly in the windy weather.\nHow to Transform Negative Feelings\nNegative feelings can cause hurt both to ourselves and to others. If we express\nanger or criticism, for example, we in\u027bict pain on someone else. On the other hand,\nrepressing such feelings creates problems for ourselves, as the stressful biochemistry\naffects the internal organs and systems down to the cellular level.\nIf both expressing and holding back negative feelings can be harmful, what shall\nwe do when these emotions boil up in us? Ayurveda o\u0283ers a way to learn from such\nsituations and resolve them in a positive manner.\nAt the moment the feeling comes up, look into it. Let\u2019s suppose it is a feeling of\nanger. Take a long, deep breath, let yourself feel the anger, and exhale it out. Give\nthe feeling total freedom to express itself \nwithin you\n, so that you look at it honestly\nand feel it. Breathe into it, surrender to it, and be with it. Breathe into it, and\nbreathe out.

When awareness goes both ways, outer and inner, understanding is total. This\napproach doesn\u2019t put a scar on the mind.\nLook at the feeling\u2014any feeling or emotion\u2014without labeling it or naming it.\nThen the observer and the observed become one. Observe with total awareness,\nwith no division between subject and object, no separation between yourself and\nthe feeling. Give freedom to the feeling; let it flower; let it fade away.\nIf the condition of aggravated vata continues, vata will move into the general\ncirculation and into the deep connective tissue, where it will generate pathological\nchanges. Disease will develop. Imbalance is disorder, and disorder is disease.\nDisease is like a child. It has its own creation within the womb of the body, according\nto a process known as \nsamprapti\n or pathogenesis, literally \u201cthe birth of pain.\u201d In brief,\nthis is how it happens:\n1. ACCUMULATION\nDue to various causes, such as diet, weather, seasons, emotions, and others we have\ndiscussed, the doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites: vata in the colon,\npitta in the intestines, and kapha in the stomach. This is the easiest stage at which to\ntreat any incipient health problem. A trained Ayurvedic physician can feel the\nimbalance \nin your pulse even at this stage, and you may be able to detect it yourself.\nVata accumulation may be experienced as constipation, abdominal distension, or\ngases in the colon. Pitta buildup may be felt as heat around the belly button area and\ncan be observed as a slightly yellowish discoloration in the whites of the eyes, or dark\nyellow-colored urine. The person will be very hungry and will crave candy and sugar.\nAccumulated kapha leads to feelings of heaviness, lethargy, and loss of appetite.\nAt this stage the individual is still quite healthy, and when a dosha starts to build up,\nthe body\u2019s intelligence creates an aversion to the causal factor and a craving for\nopposite qualities, which can restore balance. For example, if you\u2019ve eaten ice cream\nthree days in a row and kapha is building up, the thought of more ice cream will not be\nappealing; rather, your body will crave cayenne pepper or other spicy food to burn up\nthe kapha and counteract it. One should listen to this wisdom and not continue\nincreasing the cause.\n2. AGGRAVATION\nThe accumulated dosha continues to build up in its own site.

The next day you might get a cough or a\nfeeling of congestion in the lungs as the kapha starts to move upward. Excess pitta in\nthe second stage may cause heartburn or acid indigestion, even nausea. Vata rising up\nmay cause pain in the flanks or midback, or even breathlessness.\nAccording to Ayurvedic therapeutics, the disease process can be addressed at any\nstage, but speci\u0279c treatments are needed for speci\u0279c stages. In these \u0279rst two stages,\none can reverse the process by oneself, using common sense to apply the principle of\nopposite qualities, and taking some home remedies.

Here the disease\nprocess has progressed to the point where eliminating the causal factor will not be\nenough. A \npanchakarma\n puri\u0279cation program (or a similar cleansing regimen) is needed\nin order to return the doshas to their respective sites in the gastrointestinal tract so they\ncan be excreted from the body.\nAma, Agni, and the Disease Process\nThe body\u2019s biological \u0279re, which governs the transformation of matter into\nenergy, is of thirteen major types. The central \u0279re, called \njatharagni\n, governs the\ndigestion and assimilation of food. The other agnis (the \u0279re component in the cells,\ntissues, and organs) perform the local process of digestion and nutrition. When agni\nis robust and healthy, then whatever a person eats, the system digests, assimilates,\nand absorbs it, then eliminates the impurities. But when the doshas are aggravated\nbecause of poor diet, an unhealthy lifestyle, or negative emotions, they \u0279rst a\u0283ect\nagni, which becomes unbalanced. When agni becomes weakened or disturbed, food\nis not properly digested.\nThe undigested, unabsorbed food particles accumulate in the gastrointestinal\ntract and other subtle sites in the body and turn into a toxic, sticky, foul-smelling\nsubstance called \nama\n.

DEPOSITION OR INFILTRATION\nThe aggravated dosha enters an organ, tissue, or system that is weak or defective,\ndue to previous trauma, genetic predisposition, accumulated emotional stress, repressed\nemotions, or other factors. These weak areas in the body can be described as negative\nlocations, like potholes in the road. Smoking cigarettes, for example, creates weakness\nin the lungs; eating too much sugar creates weakness in the pancreas and blood tissue,\nand so on.\nThe newly arrived, aggravated humor (dosha) creates confusion within the cellular\nintelligence of the weaker tissue and overwhelms it, changing its normal qualities and\nfunctions. The quality of the aggravated dosha suppresses the normal qualities of the\ntissue and combines with it, creating an \naltered state, changed in structure and function.\nIn this way, the \u201cseeds\u201d of disease begin to sprout.\nUp to this point, the disease has not appeared on the surface, but it can be detected\nby a skilled physician or recognized by imbalances in the doshas such as those\nmentioned above. An alert person can feel subtle changes in the body. If the condition is\nnot interrupted at this stage, it will erupt as a full-blown disease.\n5. MANIFESTATION\nIn this stage, qualitative changes become apparent. The signs and symptoms of an\nactual disease appear on the surface; the person becomes sick.

But staying well is far easier than curing an illness,\nespecially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease\nprocess. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this\nchapter we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches\nrecommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.\nAwareness\nThe master key to remaining healthy is \nawareness\n. If you know your constitution, and\nyou can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing\nconditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the\nfood you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.\nAs we saw in \nchapter 3\n, the cause is the concealed e\u0283ect and the e\u0283ect is the\nrevealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency\nof the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the e\u0283ect, to prevent it from coming to fruition.\nIf a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever,\ncolds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet\nand eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese,\ncandy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce\ncongestive disorders.)\nThe knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that \u201clike increases\nlike\u201d and \u201copposites balance,\u201d give us all the information we need to maintain or restore\nour health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our\nbehavior.\nIf I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt\ncongested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days.\nWhen yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say,\n\u201cHey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!\u201d If I bring lively awareness and listen to my\nbody, it will tell me, \u201cI don\u2019t want yogurt.\u201d To listen to the body\u2019s wisdom, the body\u2019s\nintelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.\nDeveloping an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one\u2019s moment-\nto-moment state of well-being, is the necessary \u0279rst step to maintaining health.

Changes in the weather are a\npotential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata\ndosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will\nincrease kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take\naction. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.\nPotential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and\non the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts\nand feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to\nthese changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, \u201cSkill in action is\ncalled \nyoga\n.\u201d\nI have to be smart enough to know my previous history and to learn from it. When I\neat garbanzos, I get a stomachache, so \nthis\n time I should not eat them. Or if there is\nnothing to eat except garbanzos, then I can add cumin powder, ghee, and a little\nmustard seed, and it will be suitable for me to eat. The garbanzos\u2019 dry, light vatagenic\neffect will be modified by the moist, oily ghee and the warming spices.\nA substantial part of the Ayurvedic pharmacy is the Ayurvedic art of cooking. Adding\nspeci\u0279c seasonings changes the property of food and can cause a \u201cforbidden\u201d food, one\nthat might have provoked imbalance, to become acceptable. Some people, for example,\nare sensitive to potatoes. Potatoes give them gas and little aches and pains in the\nmuscles and around the joints. But if they peel o\u0283 the skin and saut\u00e9 the potato with\nghee and a little turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro, it mitigates the\nvata-provoking property of the potato and the body can then handle it. One can take\naction to modify the cause; the body\u2019s response will be di\u0283erent, and that particular\ncausative factor will not have an adverse effect.\nThis principle applies equally well to psychological factors. You may know that\nwatching violent movies upsets you and \ngives you nightmares. The violent imagery\ndisturbs your doshic balance, provoking anxiety and fear. You have observed this\nhappening to you; the next time you are confronted with the \u201copportunity\u201d to subject\nyourself to a violent movie, you can just say no.\nIt keeps coming down to the same central issue: consciousness, awareness, \u0279nding\nout, \u201cWhat is my role in this situation?

The second step is taking\naction to modify causes you can\u2019t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is\nto restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply\nthe opposite quality or qualities.\nIf you\u2019re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you\u2019re\nagitated or upset (perhaps you watched that violent movie against your better\njudgment), sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your\npitta has been provoked and you\u2019re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have\nsome sweet cooling fruit.\nThis principle seems so simple and makes such good sense that it is easy to overlook\nit in practical daily life. But it is extremely powerful and e\u0283ective. If you apply it, you\nwill find that you can quickly and effortlessly restore balance to your mind and body.\nTechniques for Cleansing and Purification\nNow we have to consider still another level of self-healing. What if you haven\u2019t taken\nthe opportunity to develop awareness, to modify the cause, or to apply opposite\nqualities to restore balance, and you have begun to get sick? What to do now?\nThe principle of opposites is almost universally valid and helpful at any stage of\ndisease. But once disease has begun to develop, it will not be su\u027dcient. At this stage it\nbecomes necessary to use techniques for cleansing and purifying your body of excess\ndoshas and accumulated toxins.\nAs we have seen, when the doshas are aggravated because of poor diet, unhealthy\nlifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, they \u0279rst a\u0283ect agni (the body\u2019s biological\n\u0279re, which governs digestion and assimilation). When agni becomes weakened or\ndisturbed, food is not properly digested. The undigested, unabsorbed food particles\naccumulate in the gastrointestinal tract and turn into the toxic, sticky substance called\nama. In the third (\u201cspread\u201d) stage of the disease process, ama clogs the intestines,\nover\u027bows through other bodily channels such as the blood vessels, and in\u0279ltrates the\nbodily tissues, causing disease.\nAma is thus the root cause of disease. The presence of ama in the system can be felt\nas fatigue, or a feeling of heaviness. It may induce constipation, indigestion, gas, and\ndiarrhea, or it may generate bad breath, a bad taste in the mouth, sti\u0283ness in the body,\nor mental confusion. Ama can most \neasily be detected as a thick coating on the tongue.\nAccording to Ayurveda, disease is actually a crisis of ama, in which the body seeks to\neliminate the accumulated toxicity. Thus the key to prevention of disease\u2014once ama has\nbegun to build up\u2014is to help the body eliminate the toxins.\nTo remove ama from the system, Ayurveda employs many internal cleansing", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2860, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa2d89d1-72d9-43ff-a0e6-0ecce58ef39a": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa2d89d1-72d9-43ff-a0e6-0ecce58ef39a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e0bc6bba-1dac-4530-b31b-4a02637a6476", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "fb64cbfe5c7968e56a7466b2a147b6a28f6bf78ad09be44148526d2cd8f01ed4"}}, "hash": "fb64cbfe5c7968e56a7466b2a147b6a28f6bf78ad09be44148526d2cd8f01ed4", "text": "programs. One of these, most widely known in the West, is a \u0279ve-procedure program\nknown as \npanchakarma\n (\u201c\u0279ve actions\u201d). The \npanchakarma\n programs used at Ayurvedic\ntreatment centers include prepuri\u0279cation methods to prepare the body to let go of the\ntoxins, followed by the purification methods themselves.\nThe \u0279rst preparatory step is internal oleation. The patient is asked to drink a\nspeci\u0279c, small quantity of ghee (clari\u0279ed butter) every day for several days. The ghee\ncreates a thin \u0279lm in the body\u2019s channels that lubricates them, allowing the ama lodged\nin the deep connective tissues to move freely, without sticking to the channels, to the\ngastrointestinal tract for elimination. Internal oleation is done for three to \u0279ve days or\neven longer, depending on the individual circumstances.\nThis is followed by external oleation in the form of oil massage (\nsnehana\n) and\nsweating (\nswedana\n). Oil is applied to the entire body with a particular kind of massage\nthat helps the toxins move toward the gastrointestinal tract. The massage also softens\nboth the super\u0279cial and deep tissues, helping to relieve stress and to nourish the nervous\nsystem. Then the individual is given a steam bath, which further loosens the toxins and\nincreases their movement toward the gastrointestinal tract.\nAfter three to seven days of these procedures, the doshas will have become well\n\u201cripened.\u201d At this point the physician will determine that the patient is ready to\neliminate the aggravated doshas and accumulated ama. One of the \u0279ve \nkarmas\n or\nactions is selected as the most expedient route to eliminate the excess doshas. These\nprocedures may include:\n\u2022 therapeutic vomiting (\nvamana\n) to remove toxins and excess kapha from the\nstomach;\n\u2022 purgation or laxative therapy (\nvirechana\n) to help remove ama and excess pitta from\nthe small intestines, colon, kidneys, stomach, liver, and spleen;\n\u2022 medicated enema therapy (\nbasti\n) to help remove excess vata from the colon.\nAggravated vata is one of the main etiological factors in the manifestation of diseases. If\nwe can control vata through the use of \nbastis\n, we have gone a long way toward\neliminating the cause of the vast majority of diseases.\n\u2022 \nnasya\n or nasal administration of medication, in which dry herbal powders or oils\nsuch as ghee are inserted into the nose to help remove accumulated doshas in the head,\nsinus, and throat areas, and to clear up breathing.\n\u2022 \nrakta moksha\n, puri\u0279cation of the blood, which is traditionally done in one of two\nways. Bloodletting, in which a small amount of blood is extracted from a vein, is one\nmethod, though it is illegal in the United States and is therefore not available here. The\nsecond way is to cleanse the blood using blood-purifying herbs such as burdock.\nPanchakarma\n is not the only method used by Ayurveda to remove ama from the body.\nDepending on the individual\u2019s strength and the seriousness of the disease, one of two\nmain approaches will be employed.

For three days in a\nrow, take about 2 ounces of warmed, lique\u0279ed ghee early in the morning. (See \nappendix\n2\n for instructions on making ghee.) For a vata person, take the ghee with a pinch of\nrock salt. For a pitta individual, take the 2 ounces of ghee plain. The kapha individual\nshould add to the ghee just a pinch of \ntrikatu\n (a mixture of equal amounts of ginger,\nblack pepper, and \npippali\n, or Indian long pepper).\nThe ghee provides internal oleation and lubrication, which is necessary so that the\nama or toxins begin to come back from the deep tissue to the gastrointestinal tract for\nelimination.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2344, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4450606-190d-4bed-b0c1-d58442324608": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4450606-190d-4bed-b0c1-d58442324608", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac1b48eb-138f-41d6-a591-1ad632bb5ec3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "35ca138eb72fe96e42549c40944a3cc15a5de84befac6081c30accd5491439dc"}}, "hash": "35ca138eb72fe96e42549c40944a3cc15a5de84befac6081c30accd5491439dc", "text": "After your three days of internal oleation, it is time for external oleation.

The best oil for vata types is sesame, which is heavy and\nwarming; pittas should use sun\u027bower oil, which is less heating; kaphas do best with corn\noil. You can do this oil massage for fifteen to twenty minutes.\nAfter the oil is well rubbed in and absorbed, take a hot bath or shower. Then wash\nwith some Ayurvedic herbal soap, such as \nneem\n.

Use \ndashamoola\n tea\nfor the enema. Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound \ndashamoola\n in 1 pint of water\nfor \u0279ve minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. (See\ninstructions for \nbasti\n in \nappendix 3\n.)

A regulated daily routine\nputs us in harmony with nature\u2019s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and\nhelps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and\nassimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long\nlife.\nWaking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress,\nand untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in\nsleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine,\nbrings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.\nOur body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda,\nevery organ has a de\u0279nite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time.\nMidday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late\nafternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.\nThis biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and\nevening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the in\u027buence of vata is greatest. In the\nearly morning, from about 2 \nA.M\n. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken\nand tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 \nP.M\n. until sunset, the\ninfluence of vata makes one feel light and active.\nEarly morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 \nA.M\n., kapha\nmakes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 \nP.M\n. until\naround 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.\nMidday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into\npitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 \nP.M\n. until around\n2 \nA.M\n., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.\nThus there is a daily cycle of vata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha:\n6 \nA.M\n.\u201310 \nA.M\n. = kapha\n10 \nA.M\n.\u20132 \nP.M\n. = pitta\n2 \nP.M\n.\u20136 \nP.M\n. = vata\n6 \nP.M\n.\u201310 \nP.M\n. = kapha\n10 \nP.M\n.\u20132 \nA.M\n. = pitta", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2235, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bb13c69-978a-4100-910c-f903aed9f345": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bb13c69-978a-4100-910c-f903aed9f345", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "414a56fc-8b65-4e4d-954a-5b29e2eb93f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "961fe96158b97a255802065ea1eb930629ec231a8d2dcafd39ab9706cbf239d7"}}, "hash": "961fe96158b97a255802065ea1eb930629ec231a8d2dcafd39ab9706cbf239d7", "text": "2 \nA.M\n.\u20136 \nA.M\n. = vata\nSo there is a doshic clock (when a particular dosha is operating at its peak) and a\nbiological clock (when a particular organ is operating at its peak).

This daily routine\nis the art of bringing harmony between the biological and doshic clocks and\nchronological time. Here are its most salient features:\nWAKE UP EARLY\nIt is bene\u0279cial to wake up before the sun rises. At this time of the morning, pure\nqualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and\npeace of mind.\nIdeally, vata people should get up at about 6 \nA.M\n., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha\npeople by 4:30.

This will bring more alertness.\nSAY A PRAYER\nIt is good to start the day by remembering the Divine Reality that is our life. You\nmay do this in your own way, as your religion or personal experience dictates.

Drinking milk at bedtime helps to induce sound sleep.

The best bedtime for\nkapha individuals is between 11 and midnight; they should sleep on their left side.\nKapha individuals generally like to sleep about nine hours, and they feel it is good\nfor them.

The best schedule for them is to stay up\nuntil about 11 \nP.M\n. or midnight, then to wake up early, around 4:30 or 5:00 \nA.M\n. and go\nout for a walk.

Thus the main recommendation\nfor everyone, especially for individuals whose \nprakruti\n is primarily pitta, is to keep cool\nand not allow pitta dosha to become aggravated.\n\u2022 In the morning, as part of your daily routine, rub 5 to 6 ounces of coconut oil or\nsun\u027bower oil on your body before bathing. Coconut oil is calming, cooling, and soothing\nto the skin.\n\u2022 Wear cotton or silk clothing; it is cooling, \nlight, and allows the skin to breathe.\nLoose-fitting clothes are best; they permit the air to pass through and cool the body.\n\u2022 The best colors to wear in hot weather are white, gray, blue, purple, and green.\nAvoid red, orange, dark yellow, and black, which absorb and retain heat and will\naggravate pitta.\n\u2022 Follow the pitta-pacifying diet from the food guidelines in \nchapter 8\n. Good fruits for\nsummer include apples, pears, melons, plums, and prunes. Watermelon and lime juice\nare also good in summer. Try steamed asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cucumber\nraita, and basmati rice. Kitchari made of basmati rice and mung dal, with a little ghee\nand grated coconut, makes a delicious light meal. Avoid sour fruits, citrus fruits, and\neven beets and carrots, which are all heating. Garlic, onion, chili, tomato, sour cream,\nand salted cheeses are also not recommended. You can eat more salads in summer than\nat any other time, as they are cooling, but they are best eaten for lunch. If you eat meat,\nyou can have some light meat\u2014chicken, turkey, or shrimp\u2014once a week. Avoid dark\nmeats, which are heating.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t drink hot water or hot drinks in the summer. Room-temperature or cool\ndrinks are best. Ice and iced drinks, however, inhibit digestion and create toxins (ama)\nin the body; it is best never to drink them.\n\u2022 A refreshing drink is cool lassi. Mix 1 part yogurt with 4 parts water, and blend 2 or\n3 minutes until creamy. You can add \u00bc teaspoon roasted cumin seed before blending, or\nfor a sweet-\u027bavored drink, add 2 tablespoons Sucanat or other sweetener and 1 drop of\nrose water. The juice of \u00bc lime in a cup of cool water with a pinch of cumin powder is\nalso refreshing.\n\u2022 Working in a hot kitchen provokes pitta. If you cook, cook in the early morning or\nin the evening. If someone cooks three days in a row, on the fourth day you should treat\nthat person to dinner in a restaurant.

Shoulder Stand and Headstand are all right in moderation. Also do the Sun\nSalutation a minimum of twelve cycles. As a maximum, you can do as many Sun\nSalutations as your age, but you have to build up to this through regular daily practice.\nFinish your yoga session with \nsavasana\n, the relaxation pose.\n\u2022 Gentle Alternate Nostril \npranayama\n is good following yoga postures. Then meditate\nfor at least ten to fifteen minutes.\n\u2022 Every morning before your bath or shower, rub 6 to 9 ounces of warm sesame oil all\nover your body, from head to toe. Sesame \noil is warming and heavy and will help to\nbalance vata. Then take a nice warm shower. Leave a little of the oil on your skin.\n\u2022 Good fall colors for pacifying vata are red, yellow, and orange. White is also\nhelpful.\n\u2022 After your yoga, meditation, and bath, have some breakfast. Try oatmeal, cream of\nrice, cream of wheat, tapioca, or any grain that will help to settle vata. (See the food\nrecommendations for vata in \nchapter 8\n.) For lunch and supper, tortillas, chapatis,\nbasmati rice, mung dal kitchari, and steamed vegetables are all good fall foods to\nbalance vata. Salads are not recommended. Mushy, soft soups and stews are good, and\nbe sure to use some ghee.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t drink black tea or co\u0283ee after dinner. Try some herbal tea, such as cumin-\ncoriander-fennel tea (equal proportions), or ginger-cinnamon-clove tea.\n\u2022 Fasting is not good during the autumn season.

Dress warmly enough both indoors and out. On a windy,\ngusty day, cover your head and ears.\n\u2022 Very active, vigorous exercise should be avoided, especially by individuals with a\nvata constitution.\n\u2022 A short afternoon nap is acceptable for vatas.\n\u2022 Try to be in bed by 10 \nP.M\n.\n\u2022 Drinking a cup of warm milk at bedtime is good in the autumn season. It induces\nsound, natural sleep. Heat the milk until it begins to boil and rise up, then let it cool\nenough to drink comfortably. You might add a pinch each of ginger and cardamom and\na small pinch of nutmeg. These herbs are warming and soothing and will help both with\ndigesting the milk and with relaxation.\n\u2022 At the junction between summer and fall, a \npanchakarma\n treatment will help\nremove excess vata from the system. (See \nchapter 4\n.) If you can\u2019t go to an Ayurvedic\nclinic, try the home puri\u0279cation treatment outlined in \nchapter 4\n.

Try to retain this oil for at least 10 minutes.\n\u2022 This procedure will lubricate the colon, calm vata, and remove stress from the lower\nback and neck areas. You can do this \nbasti\n once a week during the autumn season to\nkeep vata in check.\n\u2022 During this season, take particular care to avoid loud noise, loud music (such as\nrock), fast driving, and too much sexual activity. Avoid cold drafts and cold winds.

These postures help to open the chest, stretch the throat, drain the sinuses,\nand relieve congestion of the chest.\n\u2022 Follow your yoga postures with some breathing exercises. \nBhastrika\n (Breath of Fire)\nwill cleanse kapha dosha. Follow this with a few minutes of Right Nostril breathing,\nwhich promotes circulation and heat. (See instructions in \nchapter 6\n.)\n\u2022 Winter is a season of kapha. So, like slow and steady kapha, don\u2019t be in a rush. Be\nsure to follow your breathing exercises with some quiet meditation.\n\u2022 After meditation apply some warm sesame oil to your entire body, then take a hot\nshower.

More than 60 percent of the body\u2019s heat is\nlost through the head. Also cover your neck and ears.\n\u2022 For lunch, eat kapha-soothing food but not food that is vata-aggravating. Whole-\nwheat bread, steamed vegetables, and hot mushy soup with much ghee and some\ncrunchy croutons would be just right.\n\u2022 If you like to eat meat, Ayurveda says that winter is the time to eat it, because agni\n(digestive fire) is strong.

This will help give you a problem-free winter.\nGUIDELINES FOR SPRING\nSpring is the king of the seasons. In the Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna reveals his\npredominant attributes in the eleventh chapter: \u201cI am the Soul in the body, the Mind in\nthe senses, the Eagle among birds, the Lion among animals. Among all the trees I am the\nsacred \nBodhi\n tree, and of the seasons, I am Spring.\u201d\nIn spring Mother Earth wakes up and causes sprouting; energy moves up; everything\nis blooming and \u027bowering, full of colors and greenery. People feel energetic and love to\ngo outdoors. It is the season of celebration.\nThe qualities of spring are warm, moist, gentle, and unctuous. Due to the warmth,\nthe accumulated snow and ice of winter begin to melt. Similarly, accumulated kapha in\nthe body starts liquefying and running. That is why so many people get spring colds.

For example, \npanchakarma\n is\nhighly recommended, to clear the system of accumulated kapha dosha and help prevent\nallergies, hay fever, colds, and sinus congestion.\n\u2022 Good herbs for spring include ginger, black pepper, \npippali\n, and a tea made of\ncumin, coriander, and fennel in equal proportions. \nSitopaladi, punarnava\n, and \nsudarshan\nare also beneficial.\n\u2022 \nStrictly avoid heavy, oily food. Also, it is better not to eat sour, sweet, and salty\nfoods, as they provoke kapha. Stay away from dairy products, especially in the morning.\nAvoid ice cream and cold drinks, which are especially kaphagenic.\n\u2022 Favor bitter, pungent, and astringent foods. All legumes, such as yellow split peas,\nred lentils, and garbanzo and pinto beans, are recommended. Radishes, spinach, okra,\nonions, and garlic can be used, along with hot spices such as ginger, black pepper,\ncayenne pepper, and chili pepper. (But don\u2019t overdo these hot spices if your constitution\nis predominantly vata or especially if it is pitta.) After each meal, drink some tea made\nfrom ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon.\n\u2022 Use less ghee and fewer dairy products, and use more honey, which is heating.

It is the constant\nmovement of awareness. \nPrana\n carries awareness to the object of our\nperception; that movement of awareness through \nprana\n is called attention. The internal\nmovement of \nprana\n is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus\nprana\n and mind are deeply connected.\nThe physical manifestation of \nprana\n is breath. Breathing and mind are closely\nconnected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is\nthe psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and\nevery breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent,\nbreathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the\nbreathing is irregular and interrupted.\nAncient Vedic seers (\nrishis\n) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing\nand mental activity and uncovered the art of \npranayama. Pranayama\n equals \nprana\n plus\nayam. Ayam\n means \u201cto control,\u201d \nprana\n is \u201cbreath.\u201d By controlling the breath, we can\ncontrol mental activity.\nThe Secret of Pranayama\nThe \nrishis\n also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath\ncycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left\nnostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens\nabout every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left\nside of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the\nright hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the\nleft brain.\nThe left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left\nbrain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and\njudgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is\ndominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right\nhemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which\nis associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an\nartist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the\nright brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a\nproblem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2480, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f618fb91-94fc-4677-a826-c1d2558a7fef": {"__data__": {"id_": "f618fb91-94fc-4677-a826-c1d2558a7fef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497141dd-0bad-4a3f-b983-edd6b10277fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "55b6cb0840b4b9a9e89d3e4306c6b374354d68111c289bbc9e9598eda4521565"}}, "hash": "55b6cb0840b4b9a9e89d3e4306c6b374354d68111c289bbc9e9598eda4521565", "text": "The secret of \npranayama\n is the secret of handling the male and female energy\noperating in our nervous system.

When yogis do Alternate Nostril breathing, their male\nand female energies become equally balanced.

Life without\nmeditation is stress, confusion, and illusion.\nDuring ancient times meditation was often considered a way of life. Truly,\nmeditation is not separate from daily living, but as a discipline, we have to practice\ncertain techniques, methods, and systems. Once we have practiced a form of meditation\nand mastered it, that discipline stays with us in every aspect of our lives. So whatever\ntechnique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by\nyour teacher, please do that.\nBut what is meditation, and what is not?\nMeditation is not concentration. In concentration we narrow the mind, and a narrow\nmind is a limited mind. We need that limited, pointed, concentrated mind to probe into\nany subject, to solve problems, to learn a language, to \u027by an airplane. We need it. But\nnot in meditation.\nIn concentration we build a wall of resistance, and in the e\u0283ort to control the mind,\nwe lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they\u2019re \u0279nished,\nthey feel tired, because for that hour they were \u0279ghting and \u0279ghting, negating\neverything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.\nConcentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open,\nchoiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while\nconcentration says no to everything.\nConcentration is e\u0283ort. Wherever there is e\u0283ort, there is a maker of the e\u0283ort. The\nmaker of the e\u0283ort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the e\u0283ort.\nThe more the concentration, the more ego.\nIn meditation, there is no e\u0283ort and no \ne\u0283ort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You\nare just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry\nof a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it\nto come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is\nperipheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.\nIn listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking\nor disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you.\nFollow the sound. Allow it to pass through you. Don\u2019t resist. Then a magical\nphenomenon happens. You become empty. You become silent, pure existence.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2490, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50f92ee2-a9b7-4707-af69-0156727df353": {"__data__": {"id_": "50f92ee2-a9b7-4707-af69-0156727df353", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d97fbf3-dddd-4a4d-9881-8008c4eff3c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "2326111b434841c0ca47e8d89b64c282765ac83342b6ab86c3b85ca6a19953b0"}}, "hash": "2326111b434841c0ca47e8d89b64c282765ac83342b6ab86c3b85ca6a19953b0", "text": "When a breeze comes to you, allow that breeze to pass through you. No e\u0283ort, no\nresistance. Remember, peace is not the opposite of sound. Every sound dissolves into\npeace. You are that peace, and sound comes to meet with you and dissolve into you.\nLook at any object, a tree, a \u027bower, even the wall. There is no choice in the looking,\nno judgment, just choiceless observation.\nAwareness is the act of listening, the act of looking. No e\u0283ort is required, no\nconcentration. In awareness, in meditation, concentration happens naturally. It is given\nto you as a gift. But in concentration, in choosing, you miss meditation.\nIn expanded, empty consciousness, thinking stops, breathing becomes quiet, and one\nsimply exists as pure awareness. In that state there is great joy, beauty, and love.\nIndividual consciousness merges with Cosmic Consciousness, and one goes beyond time\nand thought.\nIn that state, whether the eyes are open or closed does not matter. It comes like a\nbreeze without invitation, because this state is your true nature\u2014love, bliss, beauty, and\nawareness. There is no fear, no depression, no anxiety, no worry, no stress. One\nbecomes the witness of anxieties, worries, and stress. In that state, healing occurs.\nThis is what is called discipline. Discipline means learning, and one who is learning\nis called a disciple. So we have to learn the art of discipline. Discipline means putting\neverything in its right place. Thought has a right place, desire has a right place, job has\na right place, duty has a right place. Discipline brings harmony in our life. Therefore\ndiscipline and meditation go together. There is no meditation without discipline, and no\ndiscipline without meditation. They are one. Mind in meditation is mind in discipline.\nThe so-called concentrated mind is a controlling mind. A confused mind controls. But\na mind that is free, alert, and aware is blissful. That mind is a disciplined mind. And\ndiscipline is the perfume of life. Without that perfume, life never becomes celebration.\nWhen you meditate, sit with your back straight. If you can, sit in the Lotus pose (or\nHalf Lotus if that is more comfortable for you). If that is not comfortable, you can sit on\na chair but keep your vertebral column erect.\nWith persistent practice, you can increase the time you spend in the Lotus to one,\ntwo, or even three hours. If one sits properly in a Lotus pose for three hours a day,\nenlightenment will soon come.\nSitting in the Lotus pose helps to open the heart. Breathing becomes quiet, and\nthinking \nautomatically slows and stops. To go beyond thought is to go beyond su\u0283ering,\nbecause it is thought that creates suffering.\nEmpty Bowl Meditation\nSit comfortably and quietly with your palms up and open and placed on your knees,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2761, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd55fe0-773e-4b8d-aaf3-edf42b3c32ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd55fe0-773e-4b8d-aaf3-edf42b3c32ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c54a647-3948-4da6-a6ad-c078c8cc7d4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "91b5a9ad9ed0b35e719bc5e9d78364b1ef589e267eed3ba49d11b79393bd7205"}}, "hash": "91b5a9ad9ed0b35e719bc5e9d78364b1ef589e267eed3ba49d11b79393bd7205", "text": "like empty bowls.

When the lungs inhale, go with the air into the\nnose, to the back of the throat, the trachea, lungs, heart, diaphragm. Go deep down\nbehind the belly button, where you will experience a natural stop. For a fraction of a\nsecond, the breath stops.

Come up from the belly button to the diaphragm, heart,\nlungs, trachea, and throat, back to the nose, then out of the body.\nDuring exhalation the air goes out of the body to about nine inches in front of the\nnose, where there is a second stop. Again, stay in that stop for a moment.\nThese two stops are very important. The \u0279rst stop is behind the belly button, the\nsecond outside the body in space. As your awareness rests in these two stops, time stops,\nbecause time is the movement of breath. When breath stops, mind stops, because mind is\nthe movement of breath.

Health-\nconscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their\nhealing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can\nmake a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible\nfor poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.\nThe Ayurvedic tradition o\u0283ers much insight into what food will suit and balance each\nindividual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations\nthat will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate\u2014and which to\navoid\u2014in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics,\nexcept speci\u0279c guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this\nchapter. (Interested readers may consult \nAyurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing\n by Usha Lad\nand Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices\nand herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious\nrecipes.)\nFood Guidelines for the Constitutional Types\nWhat you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding\nwhat to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the\nqualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or\naggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the\ntaste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its\nqualities \nare heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know\nwhether the food is cooling or heating (\nvirya\n), and its postdigestive effect (\nvipaka\n).\nIf you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully\ncomprehend these factors (see the \nReading List\n). Otherwise, the following charts take\nthese factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.\nThe charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here\nare a few points to remember:\n\u2022 Foods marked \u201cno\u201d tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked\n\u201cyes\u201d pacify or balance that dosha.

In winter and early spring, the heavy, cold, moist season of\nkapha, one should make an extra e\u0283ort to avoid cold food and drinks, ice cream, cheese,\nyogurt, melons, and other kaphaincreasing foods.\n\u2022 For individuals with a dual constitution (two doshas approximately equal), a little\nextra care is needed, but you can \u0279gure it out. For example, a vata-pitta individual\nneeds to avoid vata-increasing foods in the fall and winter (but without increasing pitta\ntoo much) and minimize pitta-provoking foods in the summer (but without aggravating\nvata). Stated in positive terms, favor vata-balancing foods in the fall, pitta-pacifying\nfoods in the summer.\nHere are some general dietary guidelines for balancing the doshas:\nVata\n50 percent whole grains\u2014whole-grain cooked cereals, some breads and crackers\n20 percent protein\u2014eggs, high-quality dairy products, poultry, \u0279sh, seafood,\nbeef, tofu, black and red lentils\n20\u201330 percent fresh vegetables\u2014with an optional 10 percent for fresh fruit\nPitta\n50 percent whole grains\u2014whole-wheat breads, cereals, cooked grains\n20 percent protein\u2014beans (except lentils), tofu, tempeh, cottage cheese, ricotta\ncheese, raw milk, egg white, chicken and turkey (white meat only), shrimp, rabbit,\nvenison\n20\u201330 percent vegetables\u2014with an optional 10 percent for fresh fruit\nKapha\n30\u201340 percent whole grains\u2014rye crackers, dry cereals, cooked grains\n20 percent protein\u2014chicken, turkey, boiled and poached eggs, small amount of\ngoat\u2019s milk, and most beans (including garbanzos, adzukis, pintos, black beans, red\nlentils, navy and white beans, split peas, and black-eyed peas)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2508, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bdd95b2-c6c1-45c3-adda-bb1f21ebd644": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bdd95b2-c6c1-45c3-adda-bb1f21ebd644", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2527f5e-e823-4618-ab72-f69b8c83f22f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "a4e08d87d325dec9c00b5022d5b752d022df41a419603353337238b817a55620"}}, "hash": "a4e08d87d325dec9c00b5022d5b752d022df41a419603353337238b817a55620", "text": "40\u201350 percent fresh vegetables\u2014with an optional 10 percent for fresh or dried\nfruit.

The qualities of sweet foods are usually oily, cooling, and heavy. The sweet taste\nincreases the vital essence of life. When used moderately, it is wholesome to the body\nand promotes growth of all seven \ndhatus\n (plasma, blood, muscles, fat, bones, marrow\nand nerve tissue, and reproductive \u027buids). Proper use gives strength and longevity. It\nencourages the senses, improves complexion, and promotes healthy skin, hair, and a\ngood voice. Sweet taste can relieve thirst and burning sensations and can be\ninvigorating. It promotes stability.\nDespite all these good qualities, excessive use of the sweet taste can produce many\ndisorders. Sweet foods aggravate kapha and cause colds, cough, congestion, heaviness,\nloss of appetite, laziness, and obesity. They may also provoke lymphatic congestion,\ntumors, edema, diabetes, and fibrocystic changes in the breast.\nSOUR\nThe sour taste is found in foods such as citrus fruits, sour cream, yogurt, vinegar,\ncheese, lemon, green grapes, and fermented food. Sour substances are liquid, light,\nheating, and oily in nature. When used in moderation, they are refreshing and delicious,\nstimulate appetite and salivation, improve digestion, energize the body, nourish the\nheart, and enlighten the mind.\nIf one uses the sour taste in excess, it can cause excessive thirst, hyperacidity,\nheartburn, acid indigestion, ulcers, and sensitive teeth. As it has a fermenting action, it\nmay be toxic to the blood and can cause skin conditions such as dermatitis, acne,\neczema, boils, and psoriasis. The hot quality may lead to an acid pH in the body and\nmay cause burning in the throat, chest, heart, bladder, and urethra.\nSALTY\nSea salt, rock salt, and kelp are examples of the salty taste. Salt is heating, heavy,\nand oily. Used moderately, it relieves vata and increases pitta and kapha. Due to its\nwater element, it is laxative, and due to its \u0279re element, it lessens spasm and pain of the\ncolon. In moderation it promotes growth and maintains water electrolyte balance. It\nstimulates salivation, improves the \u027bavor of food, and aids in digestion, absorption, and\nthe elimination of wastes.\nToo much salt in the diet may cause aggravation of pitta and kapha. It makes the\nblood thick and viscous, causes hypertension, and worsens skin conditions. Feeling hot,\nfainting, skin wrinkling, and baldness may be due to excessive use of the salty taste. Salt\nmay also induce water retention and edema.

It is light, drying, and heating in\nnature. Used in moderation, it improves digestion and absorption and cleans the mouth.\nIt clears the sinuses by stimulating nasal secretions and tearing of the eyes. The pungent\ntaste aids circulation, breaks up clots, helps in the elimination of waste products, and\nkills germs and parasites. It brings clarity of perception.\nOn the other hand, overuse of the pungent taste in the daily diet may cause negative\nreactions. It can kill sperm and ova, causing sexual debility in both sexes. It may induce\nburning, choking, fainting, and fatigue with feelings of heat and thirst. By aggravating\npitta, it can cause diarrhea, heartburn, and nausea. Pungency can also aggravate vata\n(it is derived from both the \u0279re and air elements), resulting in giddiness, tremors,\ninsomnia, or pain in the leg muscles.

Bitter is the taste most\nlacking in the North American diet. It is cool, light, and dry in nature, increases vata,\nand decreases pitta and kapha. Though bitter is \nnot delicious in itself, it promotes the\n\u027bavor of other tastes. It is antitoxic and kills germs. It helps to relieve burning\nsensations, itching, fainting, and obstinate skin disorders. It reduces fever and stimulates\n\u0279rmness of the skin and muscles.

Foods\nand herbs containing sweet, sour, and salty tastes are good for individuals of vata\nconstitution.\nHerbs and the Six Tastes\nThe taste of an herb is not incidental but is directly related\u2014indeed, directly\nresponsible\u2014for much of its therapeutic value. That is why Ayurvedic herbs are\ngenerally taken in a form that requires tasting them, rather than concealing the\ntaste in a capsule.\nThere is no problem in taking an herb that has a sweet, pungent, or otherwise\ntempting taste. But most people, particularly in Western culture, don\u2019t like the\nbitter or astringent tastes, and if they have to take an herb with either of these\ntastes, they want to put the herb into a capsule and swallow it without tasting it.\nSince the stomach has no taste buds, when the herb is taken this way, the e\u0283ects\nand bene\u0279ts derived from the taste are lessened, because they are not perceived.\nWhen we eat food, we don\u2019t lose the e\u0283ect of the tastes because we have to chew;\nwhen we use capsules, we miss the taste of the herb.\nOne of the reasons the Ayurvedic physician prescribes an herb is to balance\nwhatever taste is lacking in the body. The herb transmits that taste and its e\u0283ects\ninto \nrasa dhatu\n (plasma). \nTriphala\n, for example, provides all the tastes except salty,\nbut it tends to yield the predominant taste that is lacking in the body, which for", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1845, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93937620-5ab3-4b4a-b37e-43b0c39396c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "93937620-5ab3-4b4a-b37e-43b0c39396c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e0761d5f-4585-4c3b-b26a-adb5c2fc4dd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "b9ceefc355257cd9d0e234d4b2ed7e53d367464c1d5a6a92a6669e9117f9be15"}}, "hash": "b9ceefc355257cd9d0e234d4b2ed7e53d367464c1d5a6a92a6669e9117f9be15", "text": "most Westerners is the bitter taste. That\u2019s why for many people \ntriphala\n tastes bitter\nfor some time. Later, after regular use, the bitter taste will have been received into\nthe \nrasa dhatu\n, and \ntriphala\n may taste sour or sweet.\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, most herbs are classi\u0279ed according to their predominant\ntaste, secondary aftertaste, and \u201cpotential\u201d taste. The main taste acts on \nrasa dhatu\n,\nthe aftertaste acts on the nervous system, and the third taste has either a heating or\na cooling effect.\nThis explains why it is important to have the e\u0283ect of taste on the tongue when\ntaking Ayurvedic medications.\nPITTA\n. Pitta individuals should avoid sour, salty, and pungent substances, which\naggravate bodily \u0279re. However, sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes are bene\u0279cial for\npittas.\nKAPHA\n. Kapha individuals should avoid foods containing the sweet, sour, and salty\ntastes, for they increase bodily water. Better for them are foods with pungent, bitter,\nand astringent tastes.\nHealthy and Unhealthy Eating Habits\nHow you eat is as important as what you eat. Here are some suggestions for healthy\neating, followed by a list of habits to avoid.\nEATING HABITS TO CULTIVATE\nChoose foods according to your constitution. They will nourish you and not\naggravate your doshas.\nChoose foods according to the season.\nEat fresh, \nsattvic\n food of the best quality you can afford.\nDo not eat unless you feel hungry.\nDo not drink unless you feel thirsty. If you are hungry and you drink instead of\neating, the liquid will dissolve the digestive enzymes and reduce your gastric fire.\nSit, don\u2019t stand, to eat.\nWhen eating, eat. That is, don\u2019t read, watch TV, or be distracted by too much\nconversation. Focus on the food.\nChew well, at least 32 times per mouthful.

So if you can obtain organic,\nunpasteurized milk from certi\u0279ed dairies and heat it just to the boiling point, that\nwould be best.\nNevertheless, pasteurized milk from the supermarket, and dairy products made\nfrom that milk, are still better than no dairy products at all.\nNote that for each food in capital letters on the left, the food in capitals on the right\nis the most incompatible; foods in small letters are less incompatible.\nFood and the Three Gunas\nThe Ayurvedic tradition teaches that food is not only for nutrition, to nourish the\nbody, but also a\u0283ects the mind and consciousness. As we have a physical constitution\n(vata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha), we also have a mental constitution characterized by the three \ngunas:\nsattva, rajas\n, and \ntamas\n.\nAccording to the Sankhya philosophy of creation, \nsattva, rajas\n, and \ntamas\n are\nuniversal qualities necessary for the creation of the universe (see \nthis page\n). They are\nequally necessary for maintaining our psychobiological functions.\nBecause of \nsattva\n, we remain conscious and reawaken every morning. Because of\nrajas\n, our thoughts, feelings, and emotions move in a creative way. Because of \ntamas\n, we\nbecome tired, exhausted, and heavy; without \ntamas\n there is no sleep. Another way to\nlook at it is that \nsattva\n brings clarity, \nrajas\n brings perception, and \ntamas\n gives solid,\nconcrete experience.\nThese three qualities are also necessary for the functioning of every cell. \nSatva\n is\npotential energy, \nrajas\n is kinetic energy, and \ntamas\n is inertia. The potential energy in the\ncell is awareness; it becomes active due to the kinetic energy of \nrajas\n; then the cell\nbecomes inert because of the \ntamasic\n quality. Thus these three qualities are absolutely\nnecessary \nfor the psychobiological activities of the human body.\nPsychological Constitutions\nIndian philosophy classi\u0279es human temperaments into three basic types: \nsattvic,\nrajasic\n, and \ntamasic\n. These types all di\u0283er in psychological and moral disposition, as\nwell as in their reactions to social, cultural, and physical conditions, as is described\nin the classical texts of Ayurveda.\nSattvic\n qualities imply essence, reality, consciousness, purity, and clarity of", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2466, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c54608bd-ff8b-4c9c-8ada-75c4769c2d03": {"__data__": {"id_": "c54608bd-ff8b-4c9c-8ada-75c4769c2d03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5cf76fa7-23d4-421e-9e50-90a990e084f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "7cce3a4965e76e360122d2e359314a16cb1e114f1e24066c7270d6345b2fc3b7"}}, "hash": "7cce3a4965e76e360122d2e359314a16cb1e114f1e24066c7270d6345b2fc3b7", "text": "perception. People in whom \nsattvic\n qualities predominate are loving,\ncompassionate, religious, and pure-minded, following truth and righteousness. They\ntend to have good manners and positive behavior, and they do not easily become\nupset or angry. Although they work hard mentally, they do not get mental fatigue,\nso they need only four to \u0279ve hours of sleep at night. They look fresh, alert, aware,\nand full of luster and are recognized for their wisdom, happiness, and joy. They are\ncreative, humble, and respectful of their teachers. Worshiping God and humanity,\nthey love all. They care for people, birds, animals, and trees and are respectful of\nevery life and existence.\nRajasic\n individuals are loving, calm, and patient\u2014so long as their own interests\nare served! All their activities are self-centered and egotistical. They are kind,\nfriendly, and faithful only to those who are helpful to them.\nAll movement and activity is due to \nrajas\n, which leads to the life of sensual\nenjoyment, pleasure and pain, e\u0283ort and restlessness. People in whom \nrajasic\nqualities predominate tend to be egoistic, ambitious, aggressive, proud, and\ncompetitive and have a tendency to control others. They like power, prestige, and\nposition and are perfectionists. They are hard-working people but may be lacking\nin proper planning and direction. Emotionally they tend to be angry, jealous, and\nambitious and to have few moments of joy. They su\u0283er from a fear of failure, are\nsubject to stress, and are quickly drained of mental energy. They require eight hours\nof sleep.\nTamas\n is darkness, inertia, heaviness, and a tendency toward materialism.\nIndividuals dominated by \ntamas\n are often less intelligent. They tend toward\ndepression, laziness, and excess sleep, even during the day. A little mental work\ntires them easily. They like jobs with less responsibility, and they love to eat, drink,\nsleep, and have sex. They tend to be greedy, possessive, attached, irritable, and\nuncaring toward others. They are willing to harm others for their own self-interest.\nThere is a constant interplay of these three \ngunas\n in everyone\u2019s consciousness,\nbut the relative predominance of either \nsattva, rajas\n, or \ntamas\n is responsible for an\nindividual\u2019s psychological constitution.\nIn the Ayurvedic literature, food is classi\u0279ed as \nsattvic, rajasic\n, or \ntamasic\n according to\nthe mental qualities it promotes. In brief, \nsattvic\n food is light, healthy food that increases\nclarity of mind, \nrajasic\n food is tempting food that increases activity and agitation, and\ntamasic\n food is heavy, dulling food that creates depression and heaviness and leads to\nmany disorders.\nSattvic\n food is light and easy to digest.

At the same time, Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a\nconcurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the\nmicrocosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental\nchanges, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, \u0279nancial status, and\nrelationships. These changes are constantly bombarding every human being. To remain\nhealthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.\nAs you have learned, when the body\u2019s doshic balance of vata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha is\ndisturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the\nsymptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.\nThus, the purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications,\ndietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing\nexercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the\nsymptoms. Of course one must deal directly with emergency or life-threatening\nsymptoms, such as wheezing in asthma, heart pain in heart conditions, or high fever in\ninfections. But if the fundamental causes of the illness are not dealt with, the problem\nwill manifest again in the same or another form.\nComponents of Ayurvedic Healing\nThe Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as \nchikitsa\n (disease\nmanagement) and traditionally consists of eight components. \nIf you glance at the\naccompanying box, you will note that \nchikitsa\n is a complete healing program that begins\nwith identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by\npurifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and\nrevitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems so that the disease will not recur.\nIf you become sick, your illness is not likely to become completely healed unless you\nchange the behaviors that gave rise to it. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle,\nunresolved emotions, insu\u027dcient exercise\u2014these are some of the factors that are at the\nroot of most illness. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential\ncomponents of the healing process. If you take some of the recommended herbal\nformulas but allow unhealthy lifestyle habits to continue unabated, it\u2019s not likely that\nyou will experience lasting or significant improvement.\nThat is why, for each condition, I have suggested not only medications but numerous\nother measures you can use for healing, such as speci\u0279c yoga postures and breathing\nexercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and many other\nways to promote healing.

A\nspecific treatment, for a specific type of condition, will be beneficial.\nOn the other hand, if you do not take the time to diagnose carefully, the treatment\nmay not be appropriate, and consequently you will not get the desired result. So before\ndeciding on an Ayurvedic line of treatment, look carefully at the physical signs and\nsymptoms that will help you determine whether it is a vata, pitta, or kapha illness or\ncondition.

The pharmacopoeia of Ayurveda is vast, including literally\nthousands of medicines, many of them herbal preparations. For each condition listed\nhere, I have tried to include several very simple remedies, utilizing common kitchen\nherbs or household strategies such as taking a warm bath. I also recommend some\ncommon Ayurvedic herbs, most of which are easily obtained from various sources (see\nResources\n). For guidelines on how to prepare your own herbal formulas, how to take\nherbs, how to make ghee, and other important information, please see \nappendix 2\n.\nSEE WHAT WORKS\n. For each condition, several suggestions are made. No one expects you to\nuse all of them. Try what sounds good to you, and observe how it works. If it solves the\nproblem, you don\u2019t need to try any others. If it doesn\u2019t seem to work, then try a different\napproach. Each person is different and will react differently to these remedies.\nDON\u2019T BE DISCOURAGED IF A REMEDY DOESN\u2019T WORK\n. In self-treatment using Ayurvedic principles and\nremedies, keep in mind a fundamental therapeutic guideline. If you diagnose your\nproblem to be, for example, a vata disorder and embark on a treatment to reduce vata,\nthen \u0279nd that the treatment is not working or appears to be exacerbating the problem,\nthis indicates that your diagnosis was not entirely correct.\nThis does not mean you should give up on Ayurvedic remedies! Simply try using the\ntreatment recommended for either pitta or kapha, whichever makes more sense to you\nconsidering your symptoms. If you are untrained in Ayurvedic diagnosis, you may\nsimply have made a mistake. So use your best judgment and try again.\nSometimes the e\u0283ect of the \u0279rst remedy can give you a clue for a more bene\u0279cial\ntreatment. For example, perhaps you thought your condition was due to excess kapha,\nand you decided to use a heating herb \nsuch as ginger, pepper, or \ntrikatu\n to treat it. If the\ncondition worsens and you develop symptoms of aggravated pitta, such as irritability or\na skin rash, you can infer that perhaps the problem was actually related to excess pitta.\nReassess the situation, and take the next step.\nBE SURE TO TREAT YOUR ACTUAL CONDITION\n. Most imbalances and illnesses are related to\nconstitution. As it is often said, \u201c\nPrakruti\n indicates disease proneness.\u201d Vata individuals\nare likely to have vata-related problems, pitta individuals will have primarily pitta\nconditions, and kaphas will have kapha illnesses.\nHowever, in a small percentage of cases, your illness or condition may not coincide\nwith your own constitutional type. For example, you may be predominantly a pitta\ntype, but you may have a vata condition such as insomnia or constipation. It may be the\nresult of any combination of vata-aggravating factors in your life, such as a vata diet, a\ncold dry climate, or irregular hours. So when remedies are suggested, be careful to\nchoose options that fit the symptoms of your \ncondition\n, not necessarily your body type.\nHOW LONG TO TAKE A REMEDY\n.

This may be a few days, a few weeks, or a few months, depending on several\nimportant factors, such as: How severe is the disease or condition? How long have you\nhad it? How motivated are you to get well?\nFirst, assess your desire to get well. If you have a strong desire and are motivated to\nget results, the \u0279rst thing you need is diligence in following the prescribed Ayurvedic\nregimen. Because of the law of \nkarma\n (cause and e\u0283ect), to a great extent you will\nderive benefits according to your own actions. So in addition to taking your herbs two or\nthree times a day as recommended (no skipping, no forgetting them at home \u2026), you\nalso need to address the underlying causes of your condition by rethinking your diet,\ndaily routine, exercise program, etc. Chances are that the herbal remedies alone, without\nsome changes in your lifestyle, will not be powerful enough to override the very\nbehavior patterns that caused the illness in the first place.\nIf your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make\nappropriate lifestyle changes and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor\nfor help. On the other hand, if the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that\nsomething that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month.\nSo in deciding how long to use the recommended remedies, use your common sense.\nAnd do your best right from the start: If you don\u2019t, and you end up not getting the\nresults you would like, it\u2019s human nature that you will question whether you could have\ndone better.\nEvery disease process in the body, and every process of healing, has its own\nmomentum, speed, and duration. You cannot make the mango ripen quickly; it ripens of\nits own accord. So in order to eradicate the disease completely, allow su\u027dcient time,\nand have patience. Ayurveda is not a quick \u0279x. Anything that is quickly \u0279xed does not\nresolve the problem totally.\nCautions\nCONSULT YOUR DOCTOR\n. Some of the conditions in this book are serious medical conditions\nwhich require the supervision of a medical doctor. Mild or preclinical cases may\nsometimes be completely healed using these Ayurvedic recommendations, but these\nremedies are not a substitute for consulting with a physician.\nIf you are already under a doctor\u2019s care for a speci\u0279c illness or condition, the\nAyurvedic remedies suggested here may be used in conjunction with the regimen\noutlined by your physician. But it is only fair and proper to do so with his or her\nknowledge and supervision.\nAsk your doctor to carefully monitor your progress.

The vast majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be\ntreated at home, with such natural means as lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple\nyoga stretching exercises. But sometimes it is absolutely crucial to get medical attention\nfrom a quali\u0279ed physician or even from a trained hospital sta\u0283. This is extremely\nimportant and must always be remembered.\nFor example, diarrhea that lasts for a day or even a couple of days can be e\u0283ectively\ntreated at home (see \u201c\nDiarrhea\n\u201d). But suppose a person has profuse diarrhea that goes\non for some time, so that he or she becomes severely dehydrated. This is a serious\ncondition that requires hospitalization. It cannot be treated at home or even in the\noutpatient department; it needs admission to a hospital so that intravenous feeding can\nbegin immediately.\nOr suppose someone has a high fever, perhaps 104 or 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and is\nbabbling incoherently, appears delirious, and is losing consciousness. This is a serious\nsituation and one has to act promptly to get help.\nSo always be alert to the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease\ncondition, and be sure to treat it properly. And remember: If you are not a trained\nmedical professional, you may not always know. When in doubt, see a doctor.\nA WORD ABOUT LICORICE TEA\n.

They include emotional stress,\npremenstrual hormonal changes, and exposure to chemicals or too much sunlight. The\nproblem might also be a bacterial infection. It is important to \u0279nd out the cause, so it\ncan be properly treated or, in the case of exposure to chemicals or sunlight, simply\navoided.\nFOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET\n. Because acne is a pitta condition, the \u0279rst step is to follow\nthe pitta-pacifying diet detailed in \nchapter 8\n. Avoid spicy and fermented foods, salt,\nfried foods, and citrus fruits. Favor blander foods such as rice, oatmeal, and applesauce.\nUSE THESE HERBS TO BALANCE PITTA\n. The following formula is excellent for pacifying the excess\npitta that causes acne:\nkutki\nguduchi\nshatavari\nMake a mixture of equal proportions of these three herbs (you might start\nwith 1 teaspoon of each), and take \u00bc teaspoon of your mixture 2 or 3 times a\nday. After meals, place the powder on your tongue and wash it down with warm\nwater.\n\u2022 A helpful tea, made from common household herbs, is cumin-coriander-fennel tea.\nAfter each meal, steep \u2153 teaspoon of each of these three seeds in hot water for 10\nminutes, strain, and drink. Use this tea 3 times a day.\nDRINK BLUE WATER\n. Fill a clear glass bottle or jar with water, and cover it with some\ntranslucent blue paper (such as blue cellophane, available at art supply and some\ngrocery stores). Put the bottle in the sun for about 2 hours. Drink 1 to 3 cups of the\nwater \neach day. This will have a cooling, soothing effect.

You might try drinking half a cup of pure aloe vera juice twice a\nday.\nKEEP YOUR COLON CLEAN\n. Keeping your colon clean is important, in order to remove toxins\nfrom the body. You can easily accomplish this by taking the herb \namalaki\n, \u00bd to 1\nteaspoon daily, as a powder on the tongue. Take it before bedtime, and wash it down\nwith warm water.\nAPPLY MELON\n. Rub some melon on the skin at bedtime, and leave it on overnight. Its\ncooling, anti-pitta quality will help heal acne. It also makes the skin soft.\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Recommended yoga \nasanas\n for acne are the Lion Pose and the sequence\nof postures called the Moon Salutation. (See \nappendix 4\n for illustrations.)\nBREATHING EXERCISE\n. Breathing through the left nostril only, for 5 to 10 minutes, will help\nto reduce pitta. (This is called the Moon Breath and is said to be cooling; breathing\nthrough the right nostril is called the Sun Breath and is heating.) Simply cover the right\nnostril with your thumb, and breathe normally through the left side. If the nostril is\nblocked, don\u2019t force it; try again later.\nRELAX YOUR FACE\n. Rub your hands together vigorously to create a bit of warmth, and\nplace both hands over your face for a couple of minutes. This will relax the facial\nmuscles and increase the blood supply.\nYou can also rub your hands until the palms become warm, then gently touch just the\nheart of the palm to the eyelashes.

The root cause of acne is emotional stress. One e\u0283ective way to relieve\nthat stress is visualization. Close your eyes and visualize that the acne is clearing up and\ngoing away\u2014as if you are communicating with the tissues in your skin that are bursting\nout in acne. This works.\nA \u0279nal suggestion: Avoid frequent looking in the mirror and feeling bad about the\nacne.\n \nAddictions\n \nSee also \u201c\nSmoking\n\u201d\nWhy are people addicted? In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as\nbabies who are born addicted because of their mother\u2019s addiction), people who are\naddicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is di\u027dcult\nand unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unful\u0279lling, they may be\ndissatis\u0279ed and stressed at work, and they simply don\u2019t know how to deal with the\nsituation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.\nWhether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it\nsoon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency.\nThen, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the\nperson\u2019s brain doesn\u2019t function properly.\nTreatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder\naddictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if\na chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that\nis difficult to deal with.\nCLEANSING\n. To e\u0283ectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do\npanchakarma\n, an e\u0283ective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See \nchapter 4\n for a\ndescription of \npanchakarma\n treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a\nhome \npanchakarma\n program you can do for yourself.\nDOSE REDUCTION\n. Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the\naddictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are\navailable to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive\nsubstance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.\n\u2022 With nicotine toxicity (which a\u0283ects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and\nalcohol toxicity (which a\u0283ects the liver) we have to strengthen the a\u0283ected organs.

These allergic reactions are \nclassified as vata type, pitta type, and kapha\ntype.\n\u2022 \nVata-type allergies\n are characterized by bloating of the stomach, gastric discomfort,\nor even intestinal colic. A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing,\nheadache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when\nexposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of\nthe bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and\nother vata-type symptoms.\n\u2022 \nIn a pitta type of allergy\n, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person\ncomes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic\n\u0279bers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities\nand creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema\u2014all pitta-type\nallergic reactions.\n\u2022 \nKapha allergies\n are often experienced during spring season, when plants and trees\nshed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other\n\u027bower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people\nthey irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a\ncough, sinus infection, and even asthma.\nIn order to treat allergies e\u0283ectively, \u0279rst we have to \u0279nd out whether it is vata,\npitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.\nIn most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your \nprakruti\n (constitution) predicts your allergy\nproneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person\u2019s constitution\nand the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta \nprakruti\n is more likely to have a pitta\nallergic reaction, especially when the \nvikruti\n or current status of the system shows a pitta\nimbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions,\nemotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so\nforth.\nTREATMENT FOR VATA-TYPE ALLERGIES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2460, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76baae94-a508-497e-957b-a209e4359e5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "76baae94-a508-497e-957b-a209e4359e5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b9ed49a-031c-40b7-a644-e4ed15e6c898", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "622d2bd6164ed2907867e1b849b90df94b462b92e9e348c93d394a2cef5e3c10"}}, "hash": "622d2bd6164ed2907867e1b849b90df94b462b92e9e348c93d394a2cef5e3c10", "text": "BASTI\n.

Use this herbal formula:\nashwagandha 1 part\nbala 1 part\nvidari 1 part\nMix these herbs in equal proportion, and take \u00bc teaspoon of the powder 3\ntimes a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.\n\u2022 To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or \nlicorice\ntea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to\n10 drops of \nmahanarayan\n oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. (If\nyou do not have \nmahanarayan\n oil, you can substitute \u00bd teaspoon of plain ghee.)\nTREATMENT FOR PITTA-TYPE ALLERGIES\nHERBAL REMEDIES\n. This herbal formula is effective to pacify pitta:\nshatavari 8 parts\nkama dudha \u00bd part\nguduchi 1 part\nshanka bhasma \u00bc part\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, with a little\nwarm water.\n\u2022 For hives, rash, urticaria, dermatitis, or eczema, apply \nneem\n oil or \ntikta ghrita\n (bitter\nghee) on the skin.\nBLOOD PURIFICATION\n. Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high\npitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer\nseason, do \nrakta moksha\n, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this\npractice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India,\nas it has proven to be an e\u0283ective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it\ntoday, you might consider donating about \u00bd pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank.\nThat will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.\n\u2022 To produce a similar e\u0283ect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

Kapha allergies generally take the form of respiratory-pulmonary\ncongestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever. For relief from these conditions, use the\nfollowing herbal formula:\nsitopaladi 4 parts\nyashti madhu 4 parts\nabrak bhasma \u215b part\nTake about \u00bc teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.\nPURGATION THERAPY\n. Kapha-type allergies occur when excess kapha collects in the stomach\nand lungs. One way to relieve this congestion is purgation therapy (\nvirechana\n). \nUse\n\u027baxseed oil (available in most natural food stores), and take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a\nday for 2 or 3 days. This will be quite effective. Or you can use \ntriphala\n (see below).\nVOMITING THERAPY\n. The Ayurvedic therapy that is particularly e\u0283ective for removing\nexcess kapha from the stomach and respiratory tract is \nvamana\n, or vomiting therapy. I\nhave noticed, however, that people in the West have a strong cultural bias against\nvomiting, and many seem particularly uncomfortable with this procedure. It not only\nseems physically repugnant but may be emotionally di\u027dcult as well, as some emotional\npuri\u0279cation may arise as a result of the physical puri\u0279cation. So if you tend to have\nstrong emotions or have trouble dealing with them, it might be better for you not to try\nvamana\n.\nIf you want to try it\u2014and I want to emphasize that it is very effective for eliminating\nexcess kapha\u2014the procedure is to drink a stomach full of licorice tea and salt water and\nthen to regurgitate it, emptying the stomach. Start by drinking several cups of licorice\ntea, followed by a pint of water with about 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in. Drink enough to\nfill your stomach, then rub the back of the tongue and vomit it out.\nIMPORTANT CAUTION\n: If you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal\nhernia, or a history of heart problems, do not do \nvaman\n therapy.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2292, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bc47aec-2cfc-4302-895f-f857c8d63317": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bc47aec-2cfc-4302-895f-f857c8d63317", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d15ff8b2-008e-4abc-ac51-f4f80295bab6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "27bf73fec95e6a878023b5f7f7632ae4856cc7915e5fc9d9eb65e71a2bae8fd0"}}, "hash": "27bf73fec95e6a878023b5f7f7632ae4856cc7915e5fc9d9eb65e71a2bae8fd0", "text": "HEALING GUIDELINES FOR ALL TYPES OF ALLERGIES\nUSE TRIPHALA\n. For all three types of allergies, one can take \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of \ntriphala\n at\nnight. (See \nappendix 2\n for instructions for preparing \ntriphala\n.) \nTriphala\n acts as both a\nlaxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: \namalaki, bibhitaki\n, and \nharitaki.\nHaritaki\n works on vata dosha, \namalaki\n on pitta dosha, and \nbibhitaki\n on kapha dosha.\nDIETARY CHANGES\n. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy,\nthe pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines\nmay be found in \nchapter 8\n.)\nWATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS\n. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat\nincompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and\ndairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes\nand \u201cfruit smoothies\u201d made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities,\nplease turn to \nthis page\n.\nAVOID THE CAUSE\n. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the\nallergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should\nsimply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic \u0279bers such as polyester\nand rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing.\nBecause of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might\nconsider using only organic cotton \nproducts, though they tend to be more expensive.\nBLOCK THE ALLERGENS\n. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other\nallergens. One way to minimize the e\u0283ect of allergens that you can\u2019t avoid is to\nlubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the\nallergen with the mucous membrane.\nUSE NEEM OIL\n. Another way to reduce or avoid the e\u0283ect of environmental allergens is to\napply \nneem\n oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as\nwell as the disinfectant properties of \nneem\n, will minimize contact with the allergen.\nNOTE\n: Use \nneem\n herbalized oil\u2014that is, \nneem\n leaves cooked in a base of sesame\nor another oil. Pure \nneem\n extract will be too strong. If you \u0279nd that even this\nherbalized \nneem\n oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation,\nmix it half and half with coconut oil.\nMEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION\n. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance\nis created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to\nrestore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See \nchapter 7\n for\nguidelines.)\nYOGA POSTURES\n. The most helpful yoga \nasana\n for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun\nSalutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation.

Alternate Nostril breathing is e\u0283ective for respiratory allergies such\nas hay fever, wheezing, and sneezing. \nBhastrika\n (Breath of Fire) is good for kapha-type\ncongestive allergies (see \nchapter 6\n). Also, \nujjayi pranayama\n helps to improve immunity\nand is beneficial for all types of allergies.\n \nAnemia\n \nModern medicine has delineated several types of anemia: iron-de\u0279ciency anemia,\npernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia (lack of protein in\nthe blood), as well as certain vitamin-de\u0279ciency anemias, such as B-12 and folic acid-\nde\u0279ciency anemia. Certain bleeding disorders, such as profuse menstrual bleeding,\nbleeding hemorrhoids, or bleeding gums, can lead to anemia because of blood loss.\nWhenever modern medicine deals with the problem of anemia, it considers all these\netiological factors.\nAyurveda looks at anemia quite di\u0283erently. Ayurvedic classi\u0279cation of anemia falls\nunder three basic doshic conditions: vata type, pitta type, and kapha type. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter whether a person has iron de\u0279ciency or folic acid de\u0279ciency; what is important is\nhow the anemia is expressing itself through a particular individual. As it turns out (see\nbox \nthis page\n), there is also a correspondence between the Ayurvedic interpretation and\nthe understanding according to modern medicine.\nTYPES OF ANEMIA\n\u2022 In vata-type anemia, the person looks thin, with dry, rough, scaly skin, and has\ncracking of the joints. He or she looks emaciated and pale, may su\u0283er from\nbreathlessness and constipation, and may pass tarry black stool.\n\u2022 In pitta-type anemia, the eyes are slightly yellowish, the person may get high-\ncolored urine, and the stools are dark brown or have a slightly yellowish tinge. There\nmay be nausea or pain in the liver and/or spleen area. Dizziness or vertigo may be\nexperienced, and the person may become easily irritated by light.\n\u2022 In kapha-type anemia, there is often swelling (edema), and the person\u2019s skin feels\ncold and clammy and looks shiny. Because of the edema, the skin gets stretched so much\nthat you can often see the reflection of the window on it.\nBy careful observation one can tell whether the anemia is vata, pitta, or kapha type.\nBy treating that dosha, one treats the root cause and can alleviate the anemia.\nTREATMENT\nFOR VATA-TYPE ANEMIA\n. For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking \ntikta ghrita\n, which is", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2390, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abb36ade-e57f-4a26-b2ed-971a442ab03d": {"__data__": {"id_": "abb36ade-e57f-4a26-b2ed-971a442ab03d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab1a435a-4b55-482d-a4d8-a63ba6ab5e49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "30ae6ea7ad52dae9e1cac422e9208b31f0ef6e76b772241c24553abc837c1c81"}}, "hash": "30ae6ea7ad52dae9e1cac422e9208b31f0ef6e76b772241c24553abc837c1c81", "text": "bitter ghee (see \nappendix 2\n). One teaspoon of \ntikta ghrita\n 5 to 10 minutes before\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner will help to improve the blood volume.\n\u2022 One can also use a mixture of\nkaishore guggulu 2 parts\nabrak bhasma \u215b part\nashwagandha 5 parts\ndashamoola 5 parts\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to help\ncorrect vata-type anemia.\n\u2022 A speci\u0279c formula is given in Vedic literature for a cleansing, detoxifying herbal\nremedy for vata-type anemia. It is called \ngandharva haritaki\n, which is \nharitaki\n powder\nroasted in castor oil in an iron pan. Place 1 tablespoon castor oil in an iron pan and\nheat on the stove; when the oil is warm enough, saut\u00e9 1 ounce of the herb \nharitaki\n. The\nharitaki\n will become thick and will turn slightly brown. (You have to stir it.) Take \u00bd\nteaspoon of \ngandharva haritaki\n at bedtime, washed down with warm water. Take it for 2\nmonths or until the blood returns to normal.\nNOTE\n: This mixture may cause loose stools; if this happens, reduce your dosage\nuntil comfortable.\nFOR PITTA-TYPE ANEMIA\n. For pitta anemia, Ayurveda suggests \nshatavari\n ghee. (The \nshatavari\nand the ghee are cooked together. Directions for preparing herbalized and medicated\nghees and oils appear in \nappendix 2\n.) Take 1 teaspoon of \nshatavari\n ghee 3 times a day,\nbefore breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\u2022 One can also use this herbal formula:\nshatavari 5 parts\nbrahmi 3 parts\nneem 2 parts\nloha bhasma \u215b part\nMix these herbs, and take \u00bd teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with 2\ntablespoons of aloe vera gel.

Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.\nFOR ALL TYPES OF ANEMIA\nEAT IRON-RICH FOODS\n. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets,\ncarrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most\nanemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice\nand cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and\ncarrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum e\u0283ect.)\nChlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using\nchlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.\nYOGURT AND TURMERIC\n. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an\nempty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is\nunbalanced, eat this at noon only.\nBLUE-GREEN ALGAE\n. Blue-green algae can also be e\u0283ectively used, but primarily for pitta\nanemia. Because it is a rich source of \nprana\n, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will\nmake them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.\nCOPPER WATER\n. Vata and kapha individuals may \u0279nd copper water e\u0283ective. Fill a\ngenuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the\nmorning (see \nappendix 1\n).\nDIET AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES\n. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet,\nexercise, and so on) for each doshic \nconstitutional type. For vata problems, follow the\nanti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines;\nand for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.\nCorrelation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia\nClinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classi\u0279ed by\nmodern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by\nAyurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis\nand hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamine (vitamin B-12)-\nde\u0279ciency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to\nhypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated\nwith iron de\u0279ciency and folic acid\u2013de\u0279ciency anemia. By treating the vata\u2013pitta\u2013\nkapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia\ncategorized by modern medicine.\nYOGA \nASANAS\n.\n Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2552, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f8e3899-5173-4ebf-8120-75ec47595450": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f8e3899-5173-4ebf-8120-75ec47595450", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec0ab67f-909f-4d4c-bd8b-8ef0efb97e93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "aa240a261120d52c6358561888ccc02c0d519fec7bf8691c1a6d99beaaaa5761"}}, "hash": "aa240a261120d52c6358561888ccc02c0d519fec7bf8691c1a6d99beaaaa5761", "text": "include the Locust pose, Lotus pose, and inverted poses (Shoulder Stand, Plow pose,\nHeadstand), which bring the blood supply to the vital organs such as the thyroid,\nthymus, and brain. Headstand will not be good for pitta-type anemia, but the Sun\nSalutation, as well as the Boat, Bow, and Bridge poses, will be effective.\nBREATHING EXERCISE\n. For all anemic conditions, \nsurya pranayama\n (Right Nostril breathing)\nis recommended. Block your left nostril with your right ring \u0279nger and breathe only\nthrough the right nostril. Right Nostril breathing stimulates the liver, which plays an\nimportant role in building the blood.\n \nAnger and Hostility\n \nAnger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is\nnecessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of\nbalance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and\nhostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.\nHere are several simple home remedies to cool down that hot pitta and keep tempers\nunder control.\nDIET\n. Perhaps most important, a person who becomes angry easily or often should\nfollow the pitta-pacifying diet (see \nchapter 8\n), especially avoiding hot, spicy and\nfermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks,\nand avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.\nKEEP COOL\n. It\u2019s also not recommended for people with a pitta body type to take saunas\nor steam baths, to get overheated from exercise or sports, or to be in too much direct\nsun. In other words: keep cool.\nOIL MASSAGE\n. Rub some \nbhringaraj\n oil or coconut oil on your scalp and on the soles of the\nfeet. That will help to bring down the excess pitta. (See instructions for preparing\nherbalized ghees and oils in \nappendix 2\n.) You can do this every night before getting in\nbed to regularly moderate pitta. Be sure to wear some old socks and a hat, or put a\ntowel on your pillow, to prevent the oil from staining.\nUSE SANDALWOOD OIL\n. Another simple and e\u0283ective way to help balance your emotions is\nto place a drop of sandalwood essential oil on the \u201cthird eye\u201d area between your\neyebrows, as well as on the throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists. Just a small\namount of oil is sufficient.\nHERBAL TEAS\n.

Take \u00bd teaspoon of chamomile and 1\nteaspoon of fresh, \u0279nely chopped cilantro leaves, and steep them in 1 cup hot water for\nabout 10 minutes. Allow this tea to cool before you drink it.\nHAVE A PITTA-PACIFYING DRINK\n. Into 1 cup of grape juice, add \u00bd teaspoon cumin, \u00bd teaspoon\nfennel, and \u00bd teaspoon sandalwood powder. This cooling, pitta-pacifying drink will\nhelp to settle angry feelings and other pitta symptoms such as burning in the stomach.\nGHEE \nNASYA\n.\n Dip your little \u0279nger into a jar of \nbrahmi\n ghee (or plain ghee if you haven\u2019t\nmade \nbrahmi\n ghee), and lubricate the inside of your nostrils with a small amount. (Make\nsure your nails are trimmed so you don\u2019t scratch yourself.) Then gently inhale the ghee\nupward. This sends a calming message to the brain. You will become quite tranquil;\nanger and hostility will dissolve like a cloud in the sky.\nDO BREATHING EXERCISES\n. A cooling \npranayama\n to help dissipate anger is \nshitali pranayama\n.\nMake a tube of your tongue; breathe deeply through your mouth down into your belly;\nhold the breath for a few seconds; exhale through your nose. Do about 12 repetitions.\n(See the illustration in \nchapter 6\n.)\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Good yoga \nasanas\n for pitta include the Camel, Cobra, Cow, Boat, Goat,\nand Bridge poses. (See \nappendix 4\n for illustrations of yoga postures.) Avoid the\nHeadstand or other inverted poses such as the Plow and Shoulder Stand. Do not perform\nthe Sun Salutation; do the Moon Salutation instead.\nMEDITATE\n. There is an ancient method of meditation that involves watching your every\nemotion come and go, without either naming it or trying to tame it. As the feelings\narise, breathe deeply, and exhale the emotions out.\n \nAngina\n \nAngina, or to give it its full name, angina pectoris (chest pain), is a condition created\nby kapha dosha. Accumulated kapha blocks the \u027bow of \nprana\n vata into the coronary\nartery, so that the heart muscles do not receive su\u027dcient blood and oxygen supply. It is\na kind of local anemia, resulting in pain that can be severe and frightening. Typically,\nthe pain starts from the breastbone in the center of the chest, goes to the left shoulder,\nand passes along the inner side of the upper arm to the tip of the little finger.\nHERBAL REMEDIES\n. To heal angina, the following herbal remedy is effective:\nshringa bhasma \u215b part\nmusta 3 parts\narjuna 3 parts", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2526, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f30d99fb-977b-4711-958d-c4af209a2071": {"__data__": {"id_": "f30d99fb-977b-4711-958d-c4af209a2071", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ff2e35c-d018-4c77-bcc5-a6df57acefd6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "c62353560114af1514e1881d7cf4d4bbe63ecb278c33af007d7f4f4d35b737f3"}}, "hash": "c62353560114af1514e1881d7cf4d4bbe63ecb278c33af007d7f4f4d35b737f3", "text": "Take \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.\nAnother e\u0283ective remedy is to boil \u00bd cup each of milk and water, add \u00bd teaspoon of\narjuna\n and 2 pinches of sa\u0283ron, and take twice or 3 times a day. You may \u0279nd this\nremedy beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.\nSPECIAL HERBS\n. In India, angina is often directly dealt with by taking certain powerful\nherbs sublingually (under the tongue) to produce immediate relief, as nitroglycerin\ntablets are often used in modern medicine. Ask your Ayurvedic physician about these\nherbs.\nA HEALING PASTE\n. Topically, one can apply a paste to the chest. Make the paste of ginger\npowder (1 teaspoon) and \nshringa bhasma\n (just a pinch). Add su\u027dcient warm water, and\napply.\nDEER HORN\n. Try to get hold of some deer horn. (Indian groceries and Chinese herb stores\nare possible sources.) Using a mortar and pestle or another kind of grinding stone, rub\nthe deer horn on the rough stone until a little paste is formed. Applying a little of that\npaste on the chest can instantaneously relieve angina pain.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nThe heart is a precious, vital organ. Any symptom related to the heart could\nbe a sign of heart disease or a signal that heart disease is developing. So if you\nhave any chest pain that could be due to your heart, please consult your doctor.\nEspecially\u2014but not exclusively\u2014if you get chest pain from less exertion than\nusual, or if your chest pain lasts longer than a few minutes, treat it as a medical\nemergency.\nGOLD WATER\n. Taking 1 teaspoon of gold water 2 or 3 times a day before food is also\neffective. (See \nappendix 1\n for instructions on making gold water.)\nYOGA POSTURES\n. If there is no acute angina pain, you can improve coronary circulation by\ndoing some gentle yoga stretching. Bene\u0279cial postures include the Camel pose, Boat\npose, Locust pose, gentle Spinal Twist, and Cobra pose. These postures stretch the\ncoronary arteries and increase blood supply to the heart.\n \nAnxiety\n \nAnxiety, which often is associated with insomnia and feelings of fear, is due\nprimarily to aggravation of vata dosha in the nervous system. So to heal anxiety, we\nhave to balance vata.\nHere are several e\u0283ective Ayurvedic remedies to pacify vata, heal anxiety and fear,\nand improve your sleep.\nCALMING TEA\n.

But if severe\nanxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with\nyour social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are\nthree reasons to see a doctor:\n1\n. \nYou chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest\npressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.\n2\n. \nYou have panic attacks\u2014short, unexplained periods of intense fear.\n3\n. \nYou avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.\nThis formula e\u0283ectively paci\u0279es vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this\ntea twice a day.\nRELAXING BATH\n. A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use\n\u2153 cup ginger and \u2153 cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.\nALMOND MILK\n. Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted)\nalmonds overnight in water. Peel o\u0283 the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add\n1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg\nand saffron.\nORANGE JUICE\n. For anxiety accompanied by a fast heart rate, a cup of orange juice with 1\nteaspoon of honey and a pinch of nutmeg powder can be effective.\nCALMING PRESSURE POINT\n. Make a \u0279st with your left hand, so that the \u0279ngers rest in the\nmiddle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle \u0279nger ends, in the \u201cheart\u201d of the\npalm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press \u0279rmly on this point in the center\nof your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This \nwill calm down the agitation of \nprana\n, which\ncauses anxiety.\nAyurvedic Oil Massage\nGiving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas\nshould use sesame oil; pittas, sun\u027bower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7\nounces of warmed-up (\nnot hot\n) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to\ntoes.

Lie down on your back in the yoga posture known as \nsavasana\n, the\n\u201cCorpse\u201d or Relaxation pose, arms by your sides.\nMEDITATE TO RELAX\n. Sitting quietly, focus your attention on the top of your head while\ndoing the \nSo-Hum\n meditation (described in \nchapter 7\n).\n \nAppetite, Low\n \nPoor appetite is a condition of low \njatharagni\n (digestive \u0279re). Low agni may be due to\nslow metabolism, or slow metabolism caused by low agni; each a\u0283ects the other. Low\nagni creates not only poor appetite but also indigestion, bloating, ama (toxins) in the\ngastrointestinal tract, coating on the tongue, and bad breath. Lack of energy is also\ncommon.\nThe most e\u0283ective treatment for this situation may surprise you: Don\u2019t eat. A short\nfast will help to kindle the digestive \u0279re. Skip breakfast, and don\u2019t nibble anything. By\nnoon your appetite will probably return, and you will be hungry and ready to eat.\nLack of appetite is often due to continual munching, combined with drinking cold\ndrinks, which depress agni. For the sake of good digestion and long-term health, as well\nas reviving your appetite, both of these bad habits have to be stopped.\nIf you are not hungry even by lunchtime, take some fresh ginger, chop a little into\nsmall pieces, add some lime juice and a pinch of rock salt, and chew it up. That will\nkindle agni and stimulate the appetite.\nLow appetite may also be due to emotional factors. If that is the case, make a tea of\nginger, \nbrahmi\n, and chamomile in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of this mixture per\ncup of water, steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.\nAlso, take \u00bd teaspoon of \ntriphala\n in a cup of warm water every night before going to\nbed. Pour boiling water into the \ntriphala\n, and let it cool until it\u2019s comfortable to drink.\nThese few simple measures should be enough to help you regain a healthy appetite.\nIf you try them and still don\u2019t feel like eating, see your doctor, as lack of appetite can be\na symptom of a more serious illness.\n \nArthritis\n \nAyurveda distinguishes three categories of arthritis, corresponding to vata, pitta, and\nkapha.

They become dry and are not\nswollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to\nthe touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular\ntender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to\naggravate the pain.\n\u2022 \nPitta-type arthritis\n is characterized by in\u027bammation; the joint becomes swollen and \nis\npainful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.\n\u2022 \nIn kapha-type arthritis\n, the joint also becomes sti\u0283 and swollen, but it feels cold and\nclammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to\nrelieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around,\nthe pain diminishes.\nFOR ALL TYPES OF ARTHRITIS\nTreatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for\nall cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.\nDepending on the person\u2019s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta,\nor kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive\nfire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.\nVata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels\nthrough the system and lodges in the \nasthi dhatu\n (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving\nrise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.\nSo our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back\nto the colon, and then to eliminate it.\nThis is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish\nthis, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking\ntriphala\n at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (\u00bd to 1 cup) will be effective for all\ntypes. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use \nharitaki\n for\nvata-type arthritis, \namalaki\n for pitta-type, and \nbibhitaki\n for kapha-type arthritis (\u00bd to 1\nteaspoon with warm water in all cases).\nNow for the complete treatments.\nFOR VATA-TYPE ARTHRITIS\n\u2022 Follow the vata-pacifying diet (\nchapter 8\n). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and\navoid cold foods and drinks, including salads.

If the attack is not stopped, the person may have increasing\ndifficulty breathing.\nThe underlying cause of all asthmatic conditions is increased kapha dosha in the\nstomach.

It has become an occupational hazard\nin many di\u0283erent kinds of work. People may pull or strain their back muscles while\nlifting a heavy load or while sitting at a desk in front of a computer. Emotional factors\ncan also lead to back pain, as can injuries, such as from a car accident. Some people\nmay even have a slipped disk, which can lead to severe back pain. Whatever the cause\nof your backache, the following natural Ayurvedic home remedies will be helpful.\nHERBAL REMEDIES\n. Take \nyogaraj guggulu\n, 1 tablet 3 times a day, or 1 tablet of \nkaishore\nguggulu\n 2 or 3 times a day. Both of these special Ayurvedic formulas are available from\nmost sources of Ayurvedic herbs (see \nResources\n).\n\u2022 Backache can also be relieved by the use of the herb \nmusta\n, which is a muscle\npainkiller. Take \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.\n\u2022 The herbs \ntagara\n and valerian are muscle relaxants. Taking \u00bd teaspoon of either\nwith some warm water will relax the muscles that may be causing back pain. It will also\nhelp induce restful sleep.\nMost back pain can be e\u0283ectively treated with these herbs, but a ruptured or slipped\ndisk often requires intensive medical care.\nRUB IN SOME OIL\n. Rubbing the painful area of the back with \nmahanarayan\n oil is also\ne\u0283ective for relieving the pain. Vata and pitta types should just rub the oil on the\nsurface, while kapha types should give a deeper massage to the area for some time.\nAlternatively, try this procedure: Apply a paste made of ginger powder mixed with\nsu\u027dcient water to the a\u0283ected area. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes, wash it o\u0283, and\nthen rub the back with some eucalyptus oil.\n(Unless your back pain is in the neck or shoulder area, these back rubs will have to\nbe done by a friend!)\nTAKE A HOT HERBALIZED BATH\n. For extra healing and muscle relaxation, apply the\nmahanarayan\n oil on your back and then follow with a hot bath in which you put some\nginger powder and baking soda (\u2153 cup of each). Soak in the tub for 10 to 15 minutes.\nYou may repeat this bath 2 or 3 times a week, perhaps on Tuesday, Thursday, and\nSaturday.\nAN ENEMA CAN HELP\n. Individuals who su\u0283er from backache often get constipated, and it\nmay be di\u027dcult to tell which is the e\u0283ect and which is the cause.

Avoid most beans, including black beans, pinto beans, adzuki\nbeans, and garbanzo beans. Avoid raw, cold salads. (See \nchapter 8\n for more on the vata-\npacifying diet.)\n\u2022 Avoid exposure to cold weather or cold winds.\n\u2022 Sit quietly and meditate, or observe your breathing. This will help relax tense\nmuscles. (For help with meditation, see \nchapter 7\n.)\n\u2022 Don\u2019t walk in high-heeled shoes.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t try to do jogging, jumping, or other strenuous exercise, rather, do some gentle\nyoga stretching as mentioned above.\n\u2022 Sexual activity should be minimized.\nFollowing these guidelines will help you heal your aching back as well as avoid back", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d82d5d49-54ed-4378-84c7-c3b4870d299e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d82d5d49-54ed-4378-84c7-c3b4870d299e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6eae4e45-dcb3-4e11-8851-170b40a0756a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "ba137d612e96ae12ee63ff05a2bbac7aae8e65b37dc710e14910e8b9fc2405ea"}}, "hash": "ba137d612e96ae12ee63ff05a2bbac7aae8e65b37dc710e14910e8b9fc2405ea", "text": "pain in the future.\n \nBad Breath\n \nBad breath is often a sign of systemic toxicity, either in the colon, intestine, or\nmouth. It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is\nweak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the\ngastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.\nStand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the\ntongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.\nThe primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric \u0279re (agni),\nwhich in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several\neffective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.\nDIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES\n\u2022 First monitor your diet. It\u2019s important not to eat heavy meals, and to stay away\nfrom cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt, all of which reduce the gastric \u0279re \nand\nslow down digestion, with a likely increase of ama.\n\u2022 Then, after each meal (generally after lunch and dinner), chew about 1 teaspoon of\nroasted fennel and cumin seeds (mixed half and half). This will improve digestion, which\nindirectly helps to detoxify the colon. The licorice-\u027bavored fennel seeds alone would be\ndelicious and helpful, but this mixture will have a better effect.\n\u2022 Drink \u00bd cup of aloe vera juice twice a day until freshness is restored to the breath.\n\u2022 Slowly chewing one or two cardamom seeds also helps to minimize bad breath.\nCardamom aids digestion and helps to reduce ama.\n\u2022 After each meal, drink a cup of cumin-coriander-fennel tea (equal proportions) as a\ndigestive aid. Steep about \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon of each herb per cup of hot water.\nOTHER REMEDIES\nTAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH AND GUMS\n. Another cause of bad breath is poor oral hygiene. It\u2019s\nimportant to clean the teeth after each meal. Use an Ayurvedic toothpaste containing\nneem\n or an herbal formula. Also use dental \u027boss every day. Applying some tea tree oil\nmixed half and half with \nneem\n oil to the gums and gently massaging will help prevent\nreceding gums. Be sure to spit out the residue rather than swallowing.

It may be due\nto some fungal infection on the scalp, or to hormonal imbalance. A de\u0279ciency of\ncalcium, magnesium, and zinc may a\u0283ect the nourishment of the hair enough that the\nhair starts to fall out. And there is a de\u0279nite hereditary factor, in which genes appear to\ntrigger hair loss at a certain age.\nAccording to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and the balance\nof the doshas. Pitta individuals, and those who have excess pitta in their system, are\nmore likely than the other body types to lose their hair early in life, or to \u0279nd that their\nhair becomes prematurely thin or gray. Excess pitta in the sebaceous gland, at the root\nof the hair, or folliculitis (in\u027bammation of the hair follicles) can make the person start\nlosing hair.\nALOE VERA\n. To reduce pitta and preserve the health of your hair, drink aloe vera juice\n(\u2153 cup) or take some aloe vera gel (1 tablespoon with a pinch of cumin) 3 times a day\nfor about 3 months.\nOIL MASSAGE\n. Another e\u0283ective way to pacify pitta is to rub some coconut oil on \nyour\nscalp and on the soles of your feet at bedtime. Wear some old socks, and to preserve the\nhealth of your pillow, wear a loose woolen cap or cover the pillow with a towel so it\nwon\u2019t get damaged by the oil.\n\u2022 Massaging the scalp with \nbrahmi\n oil or \nbhringaraj\n oil at bedtime can help to prevent\nhair loss. In addition to the qualities of the oil, the massage itself will improve\ncirculation at the root of the hair, thus bringing more nutrients to support hair growth.\n\u2022 Massaging the hair with vitamin E oil may also be e\u0283ective in preventing or\nslowing hair loss.\nFOOD FOR YOUR HAIR\n.

As\nlong as the venom of the insect remains there, it may keep on creating periodic allergic\nreactions, or may even create sting-bite nephritis, a serious condition involving\ngeneralized edema (swelling) and breathlessness, and the person can choke. So stings\nand bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to\nbe watchful.\nCILANTRO\n. As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice.\nPlace a handful of cilantro in a blender with about \u2153 cup water, blend thoroughly, and\nstrain it. Drink the juice (use 2 teaspoons 3 times a day), and apply the pulp locally to\nthe skin at the a\u0283ected area. It will instantaneously pacify the itching, burning, and\nhives or rash created by the sting or bite.\nDRINK COCONUT WATER\n. One can drink \u2153 cup of coconut water (the \u201cjuice\u201d inside the\ncoconut) with about \u215b teaspoon \nkama dudha\n added. Drinking this mixture 2 or 3 times\nwill help heal the reaction to the sting bite.\nCOCONUT ASH\n. Here is another simple and fascinating remedy. Take a piece of dried\ncoconut, and set \u0279re to it. It will catch \u0279re like wax. Let it burn for about \u00bd inch and\nthen blow it out. There will be a little smoke, and when the smoke disappears, a tarry\nblack residue will remain. Apply that residue directly to the bite for instant relief.\nWhy does this work? Because coconut is a good source both for antihistamines and\nfor natural steroids.\nYou may do the same thing with the ash from burning some of the outer coconut\nshell.\nAPPLY \nNEEM\n OIL OR \nNEEM\n PASTE\n. At the site of the bite, you can also apply \nneem\n oil or a \nneem\npaste. \nNeem\n is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a\nlittle \nneem\n powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for\n10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it o\u0283. Do not use pure \nneem\n extract; instead use an\nherbalized oil made by boiling \nneem\n leaves in a sesame oil base. This is generally\navailable in natural food stores or Indian groceries.\nA HEALING PASTE\n. You will also \u0279nd a paste made from \u00bd teaspoon of sandalwood powder\nplus \u00bd teaspoon turmeric soothing and healing. Mix the two herbs together with\nsufficient water to make a paste, and apply topically to the site of the bite.\nPREVENTION\n. \nNeem\n oil is a much-used insect repellent in India and around the world.

Other bladder problems\ninclude frequent urination, or its opposite, stagnation or retention of urine in the\nbladder, leading to bladder distension. There may be pain in the bladder area while\nurinating, a condition called strangury. Let\u2019s look at each of these.\nRETENTION OF URINE IN THE BLADDER\nIn this condition the bladder is distended but the person doesn\u2019t pass urine. It may be\ndue to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or perhaps a stone\nin the urethra. The causes may be many, but the cure is simple:\n\u2022 Take two towels or sponges, one dipped in hot water, the other dipped in cool\nwater. About every minute, alternate placing them in the bladder area. This alternation\nof hot and cold stimulates the bladder, and the person easily passes urine.\n\u2022 If alternating hot and cold compresses isn\u2019t completely successful, apply \npunarnava\npaste (\npunarnava\n powder with su\u027dcient water to make a paste) to the skin directly\nabove the distended bladder. Leave it on for about half an hour.\n\u2022 If the retention is due to stricture (narrowing) in the urethra or enlargement of the\nprostate gland, then use this formula:\npunarnava guggulu 4 parts\nshilajit 1 part\nTaking \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water will help\nto dilate the stricture or relax the prostate gland and help to restore the easy\nflow of the urine.\nCYSTITIS\nCystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, drink\ncoriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea. Or make a tea of equal proportions of these\nthree herbs. Cumin-coriander-fennel tea is widely used in Ayurveda to relieve irritation\nof the bladder while passing urine.\nYou may also find this mixture effective for cystitis:\npunarnava 5 parts\ngokshura 4 parts", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1956, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0aa2d81e-81aa-4fab-a4a9-5a9d2e96af81": {"__data__": {"id_": "0aa2d81e-81aa-4fab-a4a9-5a9d2e96af81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5782317c-c027-4f0b-9401-ca349157be35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "7d30729831c0b320b3e2aa5bcc886aef7a2d92a535a7653c55149f20ca432738"}}, "hash": "7d30729831c0b320b3e2aa5bcc886aef7a2d92a535a7653c55149f20ca432738", "text": "musta 3 parts\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of this herbal mixture 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.\nBLADDER ATONIA\nThis is a condition in which the bladder\u2019s sphincter loses its tone or strength, and the\nbladder leaks urine. It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough\nand inadvertently passes some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white\nsesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unre\u0279ned brown sugar, and\nchew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple\nremedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your\ncondition is better.\nFor further discussion and suggestions, see \u201c\nUrinary Incontinence\n\u201d and \u201c\nProstate\nProblems\n.\u201d\n \nBleeding, External\n \nGenerally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself.\nThe blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases\u2014the\nvast majority\u2014there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is\nexcessive.\nSome people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate\nand clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the\nblood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause,\nfailure of the blood to clot\u2014or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed\u2014may also be an\nearly sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes\nprofuse bleeding under the skin.\nFrom the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to\na pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating\nand doesn\u2019t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription,\nthen, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take speci\u0279cally\nhemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.\nAPPLY COLD\n. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or\nwrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag\nof frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.\nAPPLY PRESSURE\n.

Mix a pinch of \npippali\n in \u00bd teaspoon of honey combined with \u00bd\nteaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick. The more he or she licks the mixture, the\nmore the appetite will come back.\nMONITOR YOUR DIET\n. One possible reason for a baby\u2019s apparent lack of appetite is that\nyour milk may not taste good to the child. If you tend to have excess pitta in your\nconstitution, and especially if your diet is hot and spicy or includes sour foods and fruits,\nyour milk may become bitter, and the baby won\u2019t like it. This unpleasant taste could be\nthe cause of the child\u2019s apparent lack of appetite. So it is important to determine the\nmother\u2019s \nprakruti\n (constitutional type) and to be sure the diet she is eating is\nappropriate.\nEMPTY YOUR BREASTS\n. If your child has a diminished appetite and you are secreting more\nmilk than gets used, it is important to empty your breasts. This will avoid congestion of\nthe mastic and lymphatic tissue. Be sure the breasts are emptied of milk at least 2 or 3\ntimes a day.\nIF YOU DECIDE NOT TO BREASTFEED\n. A related situation occurs when a woman chooses not to\nbreastfeed her child. Then the milk is stagnant, which may be one of the causes of\n\u0279brocystic changes in the breast. So it is important to empty the breasts whenever milk\nis present.\nTHERE IS INSUFFICIENT MILK\nThe child has a strong appetite, but lactation is scanty. This problem is the reverse of\nthe first. Here are several suggestions to increase the quality and quantity of milk.\nSHATAVARI KALPA\n. To increase lactation, Ayurveda recommends a delicious concoction\ncalled \nshatavari kalpa\n: the herb \nshatavari\n roasted in a pan with ghee and natural brown\nsugar. Take one teaspoon of that sweet, roasted \nshatavari\n in warm milk 2 or 3 times a\nday.\nPLAIN SHATAVARI\n. You can also use plain \nshatavari\n with ghee and sugar. Mix together equal\namounts of \nshatavari\n and natural sugar, and take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with 1\nteaspoon of ghee along with a cup of hot milk.\nALMOND MILK\n. Another formula to increase breast milk is almond milk. Soak 10 almonds\novernight in water. In the morning, peel them and blend them in the blender with a cup\nof hot water or hot milk. Pour the mixture into a cup or glass, and add 1 teaspoon \nhoney\nor date sugar, and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron.

If you are taking calcium, magnesium, and zinc as a dietary\nsupplement and your nails are still brittle, that indicates that you are not absorbing\nthese minerals. The culprit is overaccumulation of toxins (ama) in the colon.\nA safe and simple way to cleanse the colon of the ama is to regularly take the herbal\ncompound \ntriphala\n (see \nappendix 2\n).

You can take this at night before going to bed, or steep it\novernight in cold water and drink it \u0279rst thing in the morning.

When people eat some sharp, dried, or hard foods, such as popcorn, corn chips,\ncrackers, or dried bread, or chew fennel seeds after a meal, the hard, sharp food can hurt\nthe oral mucous membrane, and within a couple of days it will manifest as a canker\nsore.\nPeople who use a rough, hard-bristled toothbrush, or who press unduly hard while\nbrushing their teeth, may irritate the mucous membranes and create a canker sore. Some\nindividuals inadvertently bite the delicate tissues in their cheeks or lips during sleep, or\neven while chewing or talking. This is more likely if they have TMJ and their bite is\nuneven, which can easily lead to lacerations and canker sores. If they have high pitta in\ntheir saliva, their teeth may be sharp because the crown of the tooth becomes eroded, a\ncombination that may result in repeated sores.\nTOPICAL REMEDIES\n\u2022 The simplest Ayurvedic solution to canker sores is local application of turmeric and\nhoney.

Subcutaneous fat that\naccumulates under the skin and causes little dimples on the skin surface, cellulite is\ncertainly not a disease. People with high cholesterol, who eat fried, fatty food and whose\ndiet is excessively kapha-provoking, appear to be more likely to have it, as do\nindividuals who use a lot of olive oil in their cooking. As cellulite may gradually lead to\nobesity, this condition can be seen as an early phase of being overweight.\nIn Ayurvedic terms, \nmeda\n agni (the agni or \u0279ery quality responsible for metabolizing\nfat) under the skin becomes low. Unprocessed fatty molecules lodge there and create\ncellulite. The Ayurvedic aim in treatment is to kindle or enliven the \nmeda\n agni.\nEXERCISE\n. Regular exercise is the \u0279rst approach. Walking, swimming, or other aerobic\nexercise is important, and at least some of the exercise should be \u201clocal\u201d to the area\nwhere the cellulite is forming. In other words, if cellulite is developing on the thighs,\ndon\u2019t restrict your exercise to weight lifting and upper-body development!\nWATCH OUT FOR KAPHA\n.

Use garlic\nand onion in cooking.\nGET REGULAR EXERCISE\n. Each day from Monday to Friday, walk for at least half an hour. Go\nswimming or participate in some other aerobic exercise at least three times each week.\nJust by regulating diet and exercise, you can control cholesterol. But there is much\nmore that you can do.\nHERBS TO COMBAT CHOLESTEROL\n. Garlic is e\u0283ective against high cholesterol. Mix together 1\nclove of fresh garlic chopped \u0279ne, \u00bd teaspoon grated ginger root, and \u00bd teaspoon lime\njuice; eat before each meal.\n\u2022 Drink a tea made of 1 teaspoon cinnamon and \u00bc teaspoon of the herbal mixture\ntrikatu\n.

In addition to avoiding high-fat foods, you can eat certain\nfoods that in themselves help to reduce cholesterol. These include blue corn, quinoa,\nmillet, and oatmeal.

Taking some Vitamin C will be beneficial.\nNATURAL NOSE DROPS\n. Put some lique\u0279ed ghee (3 to 5 drops) in each nostril in the morning\nand evening. This will lubricate the nasal passages and relieve the irritation and\nsneezing of a cold.\nHOT WATER\n. Drinking hot water several times a day is an e\u0283ective way to remove toxins\nfrom the system and hasten recovery from a cold.\nNO DAIRY PRODUCTS\n. Strictly avoid dairy products such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and milk,\nand all cold drinks.\nBE SURE TO REST\n. Rest is very important for healing. As much as possible, rest, read, and\nrelax.\nONLY MILD EXERCISE\n. Ayurveda says that when you have a cold, it is best not to do vigorous\nexercise, which can set up the conditions for the cold to move into the chest. Just do\nsome gentle yoga \nasanas. Surya namaskar\n (Sun Salutation) is bene\u0279cial. The inverted\npostures, including Shoulder Stand and Headstand (hold for only about 1 minute), as\nwell as Forward Bend, help to \nprevent postnasal drip and help to drain the mucus\nthrough the nose.\nBREATHING EXERCISE\n. Use the Breath of Fire breathing exercise to help burn up your cold.\nInhale normally and passively, but exhale forcefully, and repeat rapidly several times.\nThis exercise will help to eliminate mucus from the respiratory tract.

This will also help to relieve congestion (see \nchapter 6\n).\nPREVENTION\n. As a preventive measure, take the herb \namalaki\n. It is a \nrasayana\n(rejuvenative tonic) and a good source of vitamin C and iron. Taking 1 teaspoon of\namalaki\n daily, with warm water at night, will help to prevent the common cold.\nIf you are taking triphala at night\n, you are already taking \namalaki\n, it is one of the three\nherbs that constitute \ntriphala\n (along with \nharitaki\n and \nbibhitaki)\n. Taking extra \namalaki\n is\nnot recommended, as it would create diarrhea.\n \nColitis\n \nColitis is caused when vata pushes pitta into the colon and in\u027bammation occurs. The\nbasic line of treatment is to pacify pitta.\nHERBAL REMEDIES\n\u2022 An excellent herbal remedy for colitis is:\nshatavari 4 parts\nshanka bhasma \u215b part\nkama dudha \u215b part\nsanjivani 2 parts\nTake \u00bc teaspoon of this mixture with warm water 2 or 3 times a day for 1 or\n2 months.\n\u2022 You can also take aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon twice a day. Aloe vera is cooling and\ngood for reducing pitta.\nENEMAS\nHEALING ENEMA FOR ULCERATIVE COLITIS\n. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by diarrhea, mucus,\nand blood from the rectum. For that condition, Ayurveda suggests a \nbasti\n (enema) using\n(instead of plain water) a tea made from an astringent herb such as \nbilva, ashoka\n,\nsandalwood, or licorice root. This is how to prepare the enema:\nBoil 1 tablespoon of the herb (such as licorice powder) in 1 pint of water for 5\nminutes. Strain, and add about 2 tablespoons of ghee while the tea is still warm. Let the\nliquid cool to room temperature, and use it for an enema. Retain the liquid inside for 5\nminutes if you can. Do this procedure once or twice a week.

The colon is the seat of vata. This vata dosha is pulling or pushing\npitta into the colon, which then causes the colitis. To combat the excess pitta and at the\nsame time pacify vata, Ayurveda suggests injecting a cooling oil such as coconut oil into\nthe rectum. Use about 1 cup of slightly warmed oil as a \nbasti\n, and try to retain it for 5\nminutes, but don\u2019t worry if it comes out more quickly.\nDIETARY REMEDIES\nTWO APPLE REMEDIES\n.\n\u2022 A simple and bene\u0279cial remedy for colitis is to eat cooked apples with a pinch of\nnutmeg. Peel a couple of apples, remove the seeds, and cook. Make them into a pulp\n(you can use a potato masher), and add 1 teaspoon ghee and a pinch of nutmeg. This\nwill help to pacify the irritation of colitis and ulcerative colitis.\n\u2022 Apple juice will also help relieve the burning sensation.\nDIETARY PRECAUTIONS\n. A person with ulcerative colitis should never eat hot spicy food,\ndrink alcohol, or use tobacco, all of which provoke pitta and will signi\u0279cantly irritate\nthe colon.\nEXERCISES TO STRENGTHEN THE COLON\nLEG LIFT\n. When a person has ulcerative colitis, the colon is very weak. To strengthen\nthe wall of the colon, lie \u027bat on your back and gradually lift both your legs, keeping the\nknees as straight as you can, until the legs are at a 45-degree angle to the \u027boor. This\nexercise is called a Leg Lift. If you \u0279nd it di\u027dcult to lift both legs together, you can lift\none leg and then the other. Hold your legs in the raised position for just a few seconds at\nfirst, up to 1 minute after several weeks of practice.\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Slowly move into the Chest-Knee pose, then the Plow pose, Locust pose,\nand if you can, the Elevated Lotus. Also, exercise your abdomen by drawing it gradually\nin and out. This will strengthen the wall of the colon. Illustrations of yoga postures are\nin \nappendix 4\n.\n \nConjunctivitis\n \nThis is a pitta condition involving in\u027bammation of the conjunctiva of the eyes, which\nmakes the eyes red and photophobic (highly sensitive to light), with discharge and a\nburning sensation.

It is caused by insu\u027dcient \u0279ber in the diet, insu\u027dcient water intake, lack of\nexercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create\ndistension and discomfort, \u027batulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead\nto absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping\nvata in balance.\nFOLLOW THE VATA-PACIFYING DIET\n. One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if\nyou have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet (see\nchapter 8\n). Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans;\nfavor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is\nhelpful.\nTRIPHALA\n. Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is \ntriphala\n, a\ncombination \nof three herbs bene\u0279cial for all doshic types (see \nappendix 2\n). Most\nproblems with constipation can be corrected by taking \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of \ntriphala\n at\nnight. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.\nSome people \u0279nd that taking \ntriphala\n at night creates a diuretic action and they have\nto get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the \ntriphala\n in a\ncup of warm water overnight and drink it \u0279rst thing in the morning. Actually, the best\ntime to take \ntriphala\n is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 \nA.M\n., but do your best\nwithin your daily schedule.\nHere are some further recommendations to help relieve constipation:\nSNACK ON FRUIT\n. Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. So in between\nmeals, eat some fruit. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow\nbananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation. (But don\u2019t eat the\nbananas with meals. They don\u2019t combine well with other foods. See \nchapter 8\n for tips on\nhealthy food combining.)\nNOTE\n: Bananas should be eaten when ripe. You can tell a ripe banana by its\nbright yellow skin. The inside will be studded with tiny black dots. Green\nbananas are constipating and should be avoided. Also avoid eating bananas\nonce the skin turns black. They are overripe.\nAN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY\n. There is a lot of truth in this old folk saying. Apples are\ne\u0283ective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth.

Don\u2019t forget that fresh fruit and vegetables as well as whole\ngrains are high in fiber, too.\nMILK AND GHEE\u2014MILD AND EFFECTIVE\n. Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at\nbedtime is an e\u0283ective but gentle means of relieving constipation. This is especially\ngood for vata and pitta constitutions, but it may be too kapha-increasing for kapha\ntypes to use regularly.\nCASTOR OIL\n. Castor oil can also be used, but only when the constipation is more\nobstinate. At bedtime, make yourself a cup of ginger tea (either by boiling some fresh,\nsliced ginger in water, or adding some powdered ginger to a cup of hot water), and then\nadd 2 teaspoons of castor oil to the tea and drink it.\nIf 2 teaspoons don\u2019t bring the desired result, try the procedure again the next night,\nincreasing the dose to 3 teaspoons, and then go to 4 teaspoons if necessary. Adjust your\ndose according to what works.\nSUGGESTION\n: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends, when you can\nstay home!\nCastor oil tends to create dependency, in the sense that once you use it, other\npurgatives rarely work. That is why it is recommended to use castor oil for constipation\nonly in severe cases or in emergencies, as a last resort, but not on a regular basis.\nHowever, there is one way to avoid this dependency. Take 2 teaspoons of castor oil\nwith 1 cup warm milk. This will give a good bowel movement without creating\ndependency.\nFLAXSEED\n. At night, boil 1 tablespoon of \u027baxseed in a cup of water for at least 2 to 3\nminutes. Then drink the whole cupful, including the tea and the seeds.\nFOR CONSTIPATION IN CHILDREN\n. Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.\nFOR SEVERE CONSTIPATION\n. If there is absolute constipation for three days, don\u2019t use\npurgatives. The use of drastic purgatives when constipation is severe can create an\nintestinal obstruction or even perforation, which can be dangerous. A better approach is\nto do an enema and then take steps to regulate the system.\nDo the enema with plain warm water, or you can use \ntriphala\n tea or \ndashamoola\n tea\ninstead of plain water. That will relieve the immediate problem. Then, to regulate bowel\nmovements, follow the suggestions in the following section.\nPREVENTION\n.

To improve circulation to the scalp, massage for a few\nminutes \ndaily with \nneem\n oil (in a sesame oil base). If a fungal infection of the skin is\ncausing the dandru\u0283, the \nneem\n oil, which has disinfectant properties, will help heal this\nalso.\nA second option is to use some eggwhite mixed with lime juice.

It\nis serious; you should consult your doctor.\nOf course it is possible to have a mild pitta depression, caused by failing an\nexamination, not getting a promotion at work, or some such thing.

As a result,\nabsorption and assimilation become minimal, and the undigested foodstu\u0283 gets\neliminated as a liquid, watery stool. To relieve diarrhea, Ayurveda aims to strengthen\nagni and to pacify whatever dosha\u2014generally pitta\u2014is aggravated.\nIndigestion, nervousness, or eating some wrong food or food combination can also\ncreate diarrhea.\nPACIFY PITTA\nThe \u0279rst line of defense against diarrhea is to immediately reduce pitta in your diet.\nFollow the guidelines for the pitta-pacifying diet (see \nchapter 8\n), especially keeping\naway from spicy and fermented foods.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nIf there is no serious illness, diarrhea is usually quite easy to control.\nHowever, this condition can also be a symptom of a more serious illness, so if\nthese home remedies don\u2019t work in 2 or 3 days, consult a doctor.\nFOUR FOOD CURES\n\u2022 Cook one or two apples until they are mushy, then add 1 teaspoon ghee, a pinch of\ncardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg. Eat slowly. This mixture is not only delicious, it will\nalso help stop diarrhea right away.\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t have apples, you can use bananas, only you don\u2019t have to cook them.\nChop 1 or 2 ripe bananas into pieces, and as with the apples, add 1 teaspoon of warm\nghee and a pinch each of cardamom and nutmeg. Bananas are high in potassium, which\nhelps to bind the stool.\n\u2022 Another e\u0283ective remedy for diarrhea is cooked rice with yogurt. Take about a\ncupful of cooked basmati rice, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and 3 or 4 tablespoons of plain\nfresh yogurt, stir together, and eat.\n\u2022 Another remedy using yogurt is to blend together equal parts of yogurt and water\n(about \u00bd cup each), add about \u215b teaspoon of fresh grated ginger, and drink.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2024, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb959eb3-6012-4ccf-b8ff-a45325631658": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb959eb3-6012-4ccf-b8ff-a45325631658", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "698f92dc-90e9-46fa-936e-1da1cf13272f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "7f485c0b78db9be996c7b862ffab0d79c05e68632215fec929a13d5212984b49"}}, "hash": "7f485c0b78db9be996c7b862ffab0d79c05e68632215fec929a13d5212984b49", "text": "HERBAL REMEDIES\n\u2022 Try ginger powder (about \u00bd teaspoon) with 1 teaspoon raw natural sugar.

For\nexample, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then\nher milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests\nthat when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a\npitta-pacifying diet.\nAN APPLE A DAY\n \u2026 A baby\u2019s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child\nsome cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add \u00bd teaspoon\nghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger.

Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby\u2019s diarrhea is often\ndue to altered \u027bora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal\nflora.

Babies may also get diarrhea when they are teething. Teeth are a by-\nproduct of \nasthi dhatu\n, or bone formation.

It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily)\nsecretions; insu\u027dcient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata.\nExternal causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use\nof soap or dishwashing soap.\nMOISTURIZING CREAM MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER\n. Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract\ndry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external\ncauses. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn\u2019t truly solve the\nproblem.\nIn general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of\nthe sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin \nlooks soft and oily. But then the glands\nbecome tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater\nsuccess if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by\nlubrication of the colon with oil enemas.\nHere are several e\u0283ective Ayurvedic home remedies to keep your skin smooth and\nlustrous.\nAPPLY SOME OIL\n. In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to\neliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you\nare pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.\nHowever, application of oil to the skin will probably not be su\u027dcient. To treat the\ninternal cause of the dryness, you\u2019ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.\nOIL ENEMA\n. Here is the procedure:\n\u2022 \nStep 1:\n Begin with a cleansing enema.

(More complete guidelines on how to do an enema are in \nappendix 3\n.)\nThis simple oil enema will make your skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous. The colon is\nan important part of the absorption process for food nutrients. Similarly, the oil in the\ncolon from the enema easily gets absorbed into the system and helps to lubricate the\nskin from within.\nFor best results, perform the oil enema according to this schedule:\nWeek 1   Every day\nWeek 2   Every 2 days\nWeek 3   Every 3 days\nWeek 4   Once\nCHERRY MASK\n. You may also \u0279nd relief from dry skin by applying a pulp of fresh cherries\nto your face at night, before going to bed.

The\neardrum may even become tight and painful.\nHowever, before treating earache, it is important to first rule out several possibilities,\nsuch as infection \n(otitis externa\n or \notitis interna)\n, perforated eardrum, or excess wax\ncausing pressure on the ear (see \u201c\nEarwax\n\u201d). Having ruled these out, one can then treat\nthe vata problem.\nTEA TREE OIL\n. Begin by pulling down on the lobe of your painful ear.

Then apply the oil to the ear with the swab.\nNOTE\n: Using plain tea tree oil may create a burning sensation on sensitive\nskin, so it is usually best to dilute it, using 10 to 20 drops of tea tree oil mixed in\n1 ounce of sesame oil.\nTEA TREE OIL WITH \nNEEM\n.\n For an even more e\u0283ective treatment, combine the tea\ntree oil with \nneem\n oil.

The\nfumes of the asafetida will quickly relieve ear pain.\nONION JUICE\n. Combine 1 teaspoon fresh onion juice with \u00bd teaspoon honey. Mix well;\nintroduce 5 to 10 drops into the affected ear. The mixture should be room temperature or\na little warmer before you put it in your ear.\nHEAT\n. Earache can also be moderated by heat.

It may obstruct\nhearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.\nWASH IT OUT\n. Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of\nit. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of\nwarm water (body temperature), add about \u00bd teaspoon of baking soda, and use that\nwater to clean the ear.

Do a final rinse with plain warm water.\nAfter irrigating the ear, it is important to dry the ear thoroughly. A good way is to\ndip a cotton swab into some rubbing alcohol, and wipe the ear with the swab.\nSOFTEN IT WITH OIL\n. Sometimes the wax is stubborn and doesn\u2019t come out easily. In that\ncase, for a day or two before doing the irrigation, soften the wax in the ear canal by\nlubricating it with warm garlic oil. Take about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, add \u00bd clove\nof freshly chopped garlic, and boil it until the garlic pieces turn brown. It will have a\npleasant smell. Then press the oil from the garlic, and strain it into a jar or other\ncontainer. (Plain sesame oil will also work, but the garlic oil will be more effective.)\nThen, 2 or 3 times a day, put a few drops of that oil\u2014when it is warm, not hot\u2014into\nthe ear. That will lubricate the ear passage and soften the wax for easy removal.\nDISSOLVE IT WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE\n. You can also use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution\n(about a 3 percent solution) to dissolve the wax. You can buy this solution in most\npharmacies. Put a few drops in the ear. It will oxygenate the ear, and the wax will\nsimply dissolve. When you\u2019re finished, clean the ear with some warm sesame oil.\nMASSAGE TO LOOSEN STUBBORN WAX\n. For stubborn earwax, massage the outside of the ear. Put a\nlittle sesame oil or castor oil on the mastoid bone (the bone behind the ear), and gently\nmassage. Pull the ear lobe, and at the same time open your mouth. This will help to\nloosen the ear wax, and it will come out quite easily when you irrigate with water.\nHERBAL REMEDY\n. The root cause of excessive earwax production is increased vata in the\nmamsa dhatu\n (muscle tissue). To deal with this, take \ntriphala guggulu\n tablets, 200 mg.\ntwice a day, for one month. That will de\u0279nitely break down the body\u2019s habit of forming\nexcess earwax.\nPREVENTION\n. Here is another excellent way to prevent the buildup of earwax. Once a\nmonth, sleep on your left side. Fill your right ear with warm sesame oil, and go to bed.\n(Put an old towel on the pillow to catch the excess oil.) The whole night, the ear passage\nwill be soaked in the sesame oil. The wax will rise up toward the surface of the ear\ncanal, and you can clean it out in the morning with a dry cotton swab. (Don\u2019t stay\nawake all night trying not to turn over; just sleep comfortably. Even a couple of hours\nwith the oil filling the canal will do the trick.)\nThe next night, sleep on the other side and treat the other ear in the same way.

But if\nyou often continue eating even though you are full, you might be a victim of binge\neating disorder or bulimia.\nIndividuals with bulimia eat to excess and then induce vomiting to avoid gaining\nweight, while those with binge eating disorder overeat but don\u2019t induce vomiting. Binge\neating may lead to obesity, and bulimia may lead to metabolic disorders.\nOVEREATING\n. Overeating of all kinds is most often the result of psychological and\nemotional factors, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, grief, and sadness. To compensate\nfor those emotions, people go on eating.\nANOREXIA\n. Anorexia nervosa is a serious problem, usually among young women who\nhave a fear of being fat and purposefully starve themselves. The root cause of anorexia\nis often depression.\nSUGGESTED REMEDIES\nHere are some brief suggestions to help you deal e\u0283ectively with these eating\ndisorders. For more complete treatments, please see \u201c\nOvereating\n\u201d and \u201c\nObesity\n.\u201d\nFOLLOW A LOW-FAT DIET\n. Avoid fatty fried food, cheese, yogurt, excess carbohydrates, ice\ncream. These kapha-inducing substances lead to weight gain and possibly to obesity.\nEAT HOT SPICY FOOD\n. When cooking, add garam masala, chili pepper, cayenne pepper,\ncurry pepper, turmeric, cumin, and the like to your food. These spices will burn the ama\nthat causes overeating.\nEAT TWO OR THREE MEALS A DAY\n. That\u2019s all. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but skip between-\nmeal snacking. While eating, play some soft, gentle music such as classical Indian music;\nchoose a gentle, loving raga. Don\u2019t listen to jazz or rock; that loud music will\noverstimulate the system and cause you to eat more.\nLICORICE\n. Whenever you desire to munch, eat licorice candy, which is a mild diuretic\nthat acts to reduce kapha. Or eat a handful of raisins.\nHERBAL TEA\n. To help heal the emotional factor in all eating disorders, drink herbal tea.\nExcellent choices are chamomile, comfrey, \nbrahmi\n, or \njatamamsi\n.

There may be associated\nsymptoms such as pain or itching. Sometimes the edema may be related to an injury,\nsuch as a bump, or it may be due to torn ligaments.

Edema may also be an allergic reaction, or the result of an\ninsect bite.\nBecause there are so many possible reasons for the swelling, \u0279nding out the cause is\nessential for maximally e\u0283ective treatment. Nevertheless, the following\nrecommendations should prove helpful.\nAPPLY A HEALING PASTE\n. At the site of the swelling, apply a paste made of turmeric and red\nsandalwood. Mix an equal amount of the herbal powders together, add su\u027dcient water\nto make a paste, and apply.\nNOTE\n: Don\u2019t get this mixture of turmeric and sandalwood in your eyes; it may\nirritate the eye and create conjunctivitis.\nGIVE YOUR FEET A RAISE\n. If the edema is in your feet, raise the feet. Sit in a comfortable chair\nwith your legs resting on a footstool, or use a small table and place a couple of pillows\nunder your feet. When you go to bed, place pillows under your feet. This will gradually\ndrain the excess water and relieve the swelling.\nFOR INSECT BITES\n.

(See \u201c\nBites and Stings\n\u201d for further suggestions.)\nNATURAL ANTIHISTAMINE FOR ALLERGIES\n. If the swelling is due to allergy, take antihistamine in\nthe form of fresh cilantro juice. Chop some fresh cilantro and place in the blender with\n\u2153 cup of water. Blend, strain, and drink immediately. Also apply the pulp locally to the\nswollen area. (See \u201c\nAllergies\n\u201d for many more suggestions.)\nFINGER RING SWELLING\n. Swelling on a \u0279nger may be due to a too-tight ring. Simply remove\nthe ring. If it will not easily slip o\u0283, raise your hand high above your head or soak your\nhand in ice water for a few minutes, then use some soap or oil to make your \u0279nger\nslippery.

Individuals\nwho work in front of a computer for a long time, watch a lot of TV or movies, or do a\nlot of driving or close-up work, or who live in a city with high air pollution, may \u0279nd\nthat their eyes become irritated and build up quite a lot of strain.\nThe irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (which results from excess\nvata), or it may be related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. Or, because\nthe liver and eyes are closely related, high or stagnant pitta in the liver may be a causal\nfactor. It is important to pin down the cause in order to treat it with maximum\neffectiveness. But most of the following remedies will be helpful in all situations.\nTAKE A BREAK\n. If you are using your eyes a lot, perhaps in front of a computer or driving,\nstop every hour or two for a few minutes to give your eyes a rest.\nUSE A PROTECTIVE SCREEN\n. Use a protective screen on your video terminal, to cut radiation\nand glare.\nCHANGE YOUR FOCUS\n. If you are doing a lot of reading, stop for a minute or two and\nrefocus on a distant object. Every half hour, close the book and look at something across\nthe room or out the window. Doing something di\u0283erent with the eyes is restful and will\nhelp prevent eye irritation.\nTAKE A TEA BREAK\n. In the midst of a lot of close-up work or sitting at the computer, stop\nfor a few minutes and have a cup of tea: chamomile, comfrey, mint, or even \nchai\n (which\nhas some ca\u0283eine and will not be as soothing as the other three). This will be relaxing\nand will help to relieve the irritation and strain.\nROSE WATER EYE DROPS\n. You can also prepare a solution of rose water. Take 1 ounce of\ndistilled or puri\u0279ed water, add 5 drops of pure rose water, and use the solution to rinse\nyour eyes. Use a dropper or an eye cup, and be sure the water is neither too cold nor too\nhot. This solution will immediately soothe any eye irritation.\nSPLASH YOUR EYES WITH WATER\n.

Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles\nof your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil\nfrom staining your sheets.\nFOR BLOODSHOT EYES\n. If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange\njuice with \u00bd teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.\nTO PACIFY ACIDITY\n. If excess acid and high pitta in your system seems to be the cause of the\neye irritation, take some \nshatavari\n (\u00bd teaspoon), add just a pinch of \nshanka bhasma\n, and\ntake it twice a day for 2 weeks, with a little warm water.\n\u2022 Aloe vera gel (2 tablespoons 3 times a day) also pacifies acidity.\n\u2022 If you determine that high pitta might be the cause of the eye irritation, make a\nmixture of the herbs \nshanka pushpi\n and \njatamamsi\n in equal proportions.

Then, with eyes open, move your\neyes in this pattern:\nup and down\nside to side\ndiagonally from top left to bottom right\ndiagonally from top right to bottom left\nclockwise in a circle\ncounterclockwise in a circle\n\u2022 Hold your arm outstretched in front of you.

These exercises are bene\u0279cial for\nimproving the circulation of the eccentric muscles of the eyeball.\nAfter \u0279nishing the exercises, or anytime your eyes feel tired or strained, rub\nyour palms vigorously together for a few seconds to generate some warmth, then\nplace them \nlightly\n over your eyes. Feel how soothing the warmth is! Keep them there\nfor a minute or two to strengthen and nourish your eyes.\nSet the ghee lamp at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from you, remove your glasses, and\ngaze at the \u027bame for 2 or 3 minutes \nwithout blinking\n. This procedure will improve the\ntejas\n or lustrous quality of the eyes.\nSALUTE THE SUN\n. Another e\u0283ective way to keep eyes strong is to do the Sun Salutation\nexercise. Performing 12 sets of Sun Salutations is one of the best exercises for the entire\nbody, including the eyes (see \nappendix 4\n).\nFOR PITTA TYPES\nThe following six remedies are especially helpful for pitta types, who are more likely", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "366f1dc7-2e7c-4b43-a625-ddd2a107b125": {"__data__": {"id_": "366f1dc7-2e7c-4b43-a625-ddd2a107b125", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "780d8668-4786-47ed-a1e4-c753bec2f4c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "8fe85dd2da5a7b44aae2c09388fe8b5100e91660b0c65e92f8363c7b37679f15"}}, "hash": "8fe85dd2da5a7b44aae2c09388fe8b5100e91660b0c65e92f8363c7b37679f15", "text": "to find their eyes burning.\nTRIPHALA\n \nEYEWASH\n.

That will lubricate the eyelid and eyelashes and will also\nsoothe and strengthen your eyes.\nROSE WATER\n. You can also put 3 drops of pure rose water into each a\u0283ected eye. Rose\nwater is cooling.\nA HEALING SALVE\n. Collyrium is e\u0283ective for soothing your eyes. (It is available in most\nIndian grocery stores. Ask for \nkajal\n.) It is made of castor oil and natural camphor. It is\nblack and people use it cosmetically as an eye liner, but it is actually medicinal and\ngood for the eyes. Scoop out a small amount of salve with your little \u0279nger. Make sure\nthe nail is well trimmed. With the other hand, pull the lower eyelid down while looking\nin the mirror and with your little \u0279nger apply the salve sparingly to the inner edge of\nthe eyelid.\nSTRESS REDUCER\n. For eyestrain, Ayurveda also suggests taking a sterilized cotton ball or a\npiece of gauze, dipping it into cool goat\u2019s milk, and putting it over your closed eyes. This\nwill ease stress and make your eyes feel better. (If goat\u2019s milk is not available, you may\nuse cow\u2019s milk, but goat\u2019s milk is preferable.)\nADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS\nREAD SITTING UP\n. While reading, keep your vertebral column straight. Avoid reading while\nlying down.\nUSE A NONGLARE COMPUTER SCREEN\n.

The di\u0283erence between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint,\nespecially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish\nbetween the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nThe remedies in this section are simple, e\u0283ective means of relieving dizziness.\nBut if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a\nneurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to\nsome serious pathology.\nVertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in\nthe inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, a\ncondition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo.\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it\u2019s not treated. All these\nconditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for\ndizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.\nDizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insu\u027dcient oxygen in the\nroom.\nIf you feel dizzy and you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re spinning or the room is moving,\nfocus on a \u0279xed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by\nfocusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the \nrajasic\nquality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.\nThe kind of dizziness known as \nmotion sickness\n is often associated with nausea and\nvomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule\n\u0279lled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring\nsome candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and\nyou feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a \u0279xed point, such as the\nhorizon \nor a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.\nSometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly. There are many possible\ncauses for this, including low adrenal energy, low blood pressure, or the use of some\nantihypertensive drugs, especially beta blockers, which may weaken the adrenals. If you\nfind yourself getting dizzy upon standing up, simply get up \nslowly\n. This will help.\nPitta individuals with hypoglycemia may experience sweating and dizziness and may", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2921, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d407553-8561-414f-a4cf-01ec99efe78b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d407553-8561-414f-a4cf-01ec99efe78b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "738378e5-389c-4b68-9339-3800f78f5b78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "64cc701f785804b1c85fdff3549f7509fcaae57a01769a616dd8f0dc46227de2"}}, "hash": "64cc701f785804b1c85fdff3549f7509fcaae57a01769a616dd8f0dc46227de2", "text": "even verge on fainting if they go too long without eating. This is a form of subjective\ndizziness. Hypoglycemics have to eat on time, or they may even become unconscious.\nDrinking some apple juice or any sweet fruit juice will be effective.\nQUICK REMEDY FOR FAINTING\n. If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle\nsome cold water on the face.\nDIZZINESS FROM EXERCISING\n. Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated\nfrom sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple\nas it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta\nas well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.\nDEEP BREATHING\n. Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in \nujjayi\npranayama\n (see \nchapter 6\n) and holding the breath behind the belly button.\nEAR PULL\n. Here\u2019s another simple remedy: Insert your index \u0279nger into your ear and\ngently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial\npressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.\nNATURAL SMELLING SALTS\n. For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and\ninhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia;\ninhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and\ndizziness is automatically corrected.\nHERBAL FORMULAS\n. If you determine that the dizziness is primarily due to pitta, a\nwonderful Ayurvedic herbal formula may prove helpful. Mix these herbs:\nbrahmi 1 part\njatamamsi 1 part\nsaraswati \u00bc part\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of the mixture 2 or 3 times a day with water after meals.\nThe following formula is also helpful when dizziness is due to excess pitta:\nshatavari 1 part\njatamamsi 1 part\nkama dudha 2 pinches\nIf you take \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture a couple of times a day with warm\nwater, it will help take care of your dizziness.\nSANDALWOOD\n. Pitta-type dizziness can also be helped by the smell of sandalwood oil or\nincense.\nGHEE NOSE DROPS\n. Using ghee nose drops will also help. Warm up a little bit of ghee until\nit is lique\u0279ed.

So\nkeep the colon clean with \ntriphala\n, \u00bd teaspoon taken at bedtime in a cupful of warm\nwater.\n \nFatigue and Chronic Fatigue\n \nFatigue is physical and mental stress. However, it is not always due to overwork. In\nfact, sometimes people feel tired because they\u2019re not doing enough, not working hard\nenough. For such people, fatigue can be due to boredom or lack of motivation.\nIn such cases, I\u2019ve had to ask patients to walk or to do some physical work in order\nto get rid of fatigue and increase their energy level. So the \u0279rst thing to determine is\nwhether the tiredness is due to too much physical work or too much idleness!\nFatigue may be due to low gastric \u0279re, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, or\nanemia. It may be caused by Epstein-Barr virus, a form of chronic fatigue syndrome\nrelated to high stagnant pitta in the liver. People having a history of infectious\nmononucleosis can feel very tired.\nHere are some treatment recommendations for fatigue of various causes:\nFOR FATIGUE AFTER EXERCISE OR HARD PHYSICAL WORK\n. Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch\nof rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice will help pacify pitta.\n\u2022 Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or \nashwagandha\n tea once or twice a day will help.\nFOR ANEMIA\n. If the fatigue is due to anemia, treat the anemia with blood builders such as\npomegranate juice, grapes and/or grape juice, beets or beet/carrot juice, or the herbs\nabrak bhasma\n and \nloha bhasma\n. (See \u201c\nAnemia\n\u201d for many more recommendations.)\nFOR EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS\n. If the fatigue is due to Epstein-Barr virus, treat it as a pitta\ndisorder.\n\u2022 Follow the pitta-pacifying diet (see \nchapter 8\n).\n\u2022 Use the following herbal formula:\nshatavari 5 parts\nbala 4 parts\nvidari 3 parts\nkama dudha \u00bc part\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with 1 teaspoon of\nshatavari\n ghee.

If the nourishment you derive\nfrom eating is insufficient, naturally your energy will be low.\n\u2022 One of the best ways to kindle agni is to use some ginger. Before each meal, chop or\ngrate a little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and chew it\nup. Or just cut a thin slice of fresh ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.\n\u2022 Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They counteract agni\nand impede effective digestion. Take small sips of warm water during the meal.\n\u2022 Taking \nchitrak-adivati\n, one 200-mg. tablet twice a day, after lunch and dinner, will\nhelp kindle the fire and the fatigue will go.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nUnusual exertion, stress, lack of sleep, and a number of other factors can\nmake you understandably tired. But if you use the Ayurvedic remedies\nrecommended for fatigue for a few weeks and you still have unexplainable\nfeelings of exhaustion or continue to feel unusually listless, lethargic, and\ndrained of energy, your tiredness may be due to a more serious illness. Fatigue is\na symptom of many illnesses, including anemia, lung disease, diabetes, hepatitis,\nmononucleosis, thyroid disease, and cancer. You may also have developed\nchronic fatigue syndrome. So please be wise and consult a physician.\n\u2022 You will \u0279nd many additional tips for strengthening the digestive \u0279re in\n\u201cIndigestion.\u201d\nYOGA POSTURES AND \nPRANAYAMA\n.

In general, unless fatigue is due to idleness, Ayurveda\ndoes not recommend much exercise for cases of fatigue. Exercise will burn \nojas\n and may\nincrease rather than decrease the feelings of fatigue.\nTO BUILD STRENGTH AND ENERGY\nUse the following food remedies for added nourishment and strength.\nDATES\n. Soak 10 fresh dates in a quart jar of ghee. Add 1 teaspoon ginger, \u215b teaspoon\ncardamom, and a pinch of sa\u0283ron.

There is an old saying, \u201cFeed a cold and starve a fever,\u201d and truly the \u0279rst\ntreatment recommended by Ayurveda for a fever is to observe a fast. For acute fever, a\ntotal fast is recommended if the person is strong enough.

In more\nserious conditions kapha food allergies may lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-\ntype asthma.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1848, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cde913d-ca51-400c-b8ce-8bf9843d2b13": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cde913d-ca51-400c-b8ce-8bf9843d2b13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f09631e-39a7-44d9-89f9-4621aa01aa27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "21f5e69c8c5c7c16c767a1e124da2c76051f0abfa32c1d5a7367bbfa8c18fa54"}}, "hash": "21f5e69c8c5c7c16c767a1e124da2c76051f0abfa32c1d5a7367bbfa8c18fa54", "text": "\u2022 Pitta individuals, whose systemic pitta is unduly high, will show allergic reactions to\nsuch high-pitta foods as hot, spicy dishes; citrus fruits; sour fruits; tomatoes; potatoes;\neggplant; and fermented foods. Their symptoms are likely to include heartburn, acid\nindigestion, stomach upset, nausea, and even vomiting. The person may suddenly get\nhot flashes, and may have bloodshot eyes.\n\u2022 Vata individuals, especially when vata is in excess, are prone to get allergies to raw\nfoods; beans (black beans, adzuki beans, pinto beans, and so on) and certain animal\nproteins. Vata food allergies are likely to manifest as bloating of the stomach, burping,\ngas, gurgling of the stomach, and vague abdominal discomfort and pain. It may also\nlead to insomnia and nightmares, pain in the joint, sciatica, muscle twitching, and\nmuscle spasms.\nSo food allergies need to be studied according to an individual\u2019s \nprakruti\n(constitution) and \nvikruti\n (current status of the doshas).\nTREATMENT\nThe best approach is simply to avoid the problematic food items and to follow the\ndiet appropriate for your body type. For example, a vata person having vata-type food\nallergies should avoid a vata-provoking diet and should eat vata-pacifying foods. The\nsame is true for pitta and kapha. (See the diet recommendations in \nchapter 8\n.)\nHere are some additional suggestions for each of the three main types of food\nallergy.\nFOR VATA-TYPE FOOD ALLERGIES\n. An e\u0283ective way to help bring vata food allergies under\ncontrol is to take a \ndashamoola basti\n (enema) twice a week, such as on Sunday and\nThursday. Boil up 1 pint of water with 1 tablespoon of \ndashamoola\n, and use the resulting\ntea (after it cools down) for the enema. Try to retain the liquid at least 10 minutes. (For\nmore on enemas, see \nappendix 3\n.) This herbal enema will help to pacify vata and\nremove toxicity from the colon, and vata-type \nfood allergies can be minimized. Continue\ntaking the \ndashamoola\n enema twice a week for one month.\nDrinking licorice tea made from \u00bd teaspoon licorice root powder, \u00bd teaspoon honey,\nand 1 teaspoon ghee can also be helpful. Sip a little of the tea every half hour to an hour\nthroughout the day until symptoms are relieved. Don\u2019t forget to add the honey only after\nthe tea starts to cool; honey should never be cooked. \nNote:\n People with high blood\npressure should not drink licorice tea. Substitute \u00bd teaspoon cinnamon and 2 to 3 cloves\nfor the licorice, and make the tea as above.\nFOR PITTA FOOD ALLERGIES\n. To control pitta food allergies, it is helpful to do \nvirechana chikitsa\n(purgation). Take 1 teaspoon of \namalaki\n or \nsat isabgol\n (psyllium husks) at night. Add the\nherbs to 1 cup of hot water, let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes, and drink. Stagnation of\npitta in the small intestine is the root cause of a pitta-type food allergy.

Continue\nwith \nvirechana\n daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.\nYou will also \u0279nd it helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples,\ncook them a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1\nteaspoon ghee. Eat about \u00bd cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after\nmeals.\nFOR KAPHA FOOD ALLERGIES\n. The Ayurvedic puri\u0279cation known as \nvamana\n (vomiting) will be\nhelpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2\npints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then\ntry to vomit it out. (Rubbing the back part of your tongue until you get a \u201cgag\u201d re\u027bex\nwill help.) This puri\u0279cation process will remove a lot of excess mucus from the stomach\nand help to clear up food allergies.\nIf vomiting doesn\u2019t take place, don\u2019t worry about it; the remaining salty water won\u2019t\nhurt you. It will simply go through your system and will actually have some bene\u0279cial\ncleansing effect.\nNOTE\n: Many people feel a lot of fear or discomfort with the idea or the\nactuality of vomiting. If you feel this way, do not force yourself to do this\npurification. Do \nvamana\n only if it is comfortable for you to do so.\nKaphas should also fast on Sunday. The fasting is important; it will help cleanse the\nsystem.\nMake a tea out of \u00bd teaspoon licorice root powder, \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon, and \u00bd\nteaspoon coriander. Steep in 1 cup of water for 10 minutes, strain, and sip a little of the\ntea throughout the day, about an ounce every half hour to an hour. Again, people with\nhigh blood pressure should not drink licorice tea. Substitute \u00bd teaspoon cinnamon and 2\nto 3 cloves for the licorice.\nFOR ALL FOOD ALLERGIES\n. If you don\u2019t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha,\nthen try this simple remedy that is e\u0283ective for all types: Roast some cumin, fennel, and\nwhite sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.\nTo prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, and dry-roast it\nseparately\n \n(one type at a time) on a heavy cast-iron pan. You will have to stir the seeds\nconstantly to keep them from burning. The fennel takes a few minutes, the others only\nabout a minute or two before they become fragrant and slightly brown. Put the seeds\ntogether, add about \u00bd teaspoon rock salt (don\u2019t use sea salt), and mix it all up. Store in\na glass jar.\nChewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help\nprevent any kind of food allergy.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2567, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13e3f089-82fe-4422-863a-4b0672303c13": {"__data__": {"id_": "13e3f089-82fe-4422-863a-4b0672303c13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8238e80-42bf-4f04-804e-4f12b52a0f82", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "e5fa3d062a225ee068b513fb4ec005b928d3039b0dc581bd9e7ccbb3adc400be"}}, "hash": "e5fa3d062a225ee068b513fb4ec005b928d3039b0dc581bd9e7ccbb3adc400be", "text": " \nFrequent Urination\n \nSee \u201c\nBladder Problems\n,\u201d \u201c\nProstate Problems\n,\u201d and \u201c\nUrinary Incontinence\n\u201d\n \nFrequent Urination During Pregnancy\n \nFrequent urination during pregnancy is an entirely natural phenomenon. When the\nuterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure\non the bladder. The bladder hasn\u2019t got su\u027dcient space to accumulate urine and expand,\nso just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.\nIf frequent urination disturbs the woman\u2019s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her\nrest.

This mixture will pacify vata\ndosha; by soothing vata, it prevents the excess stimulation that contracts the bladder. In\nthis way, frequent urination during pregnancy can be corrected.\nAdditional suggestions:\n\u2022 Don\u2019t drink anything for at least 2 hours before going to bed.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t drink anything with ca\u0283eine, such as co\u0283ee, tea, or cola, especially in the\nevening.

Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile\nbecomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.\nPrevention of gallstones, and what to do when gallstones are present, are two\ndi\u0283erent lines of treatment. First let\u2019s consider what to do when gallstones have already\ndeveloped.\nTO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN\n. In general, gallstones are not painful. They may remain in the\ngallbladder for a long time without causing any pain; indeed, you will not know they\nare there. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the\ngallbladder through the bile duct.\nTo reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a\nslow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of\ncastor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or \nother soft cloth, spreading it equally on the\ncloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of\nyour abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water\nbottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are\nnot recommended.)\nFOR ACUTE ATTACK\n. During an acute gallstone attack, use this herbal formula:\nmusta 4 parts\ntrikatu 3 parts\nguduchi 6 parts\nTake \u00bc teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce\nthe pain and ease the gallbladder attack.\nLIVER FLUSH TO ELIMINATE THE GALLSTONE\n. When the pain is gone, you can do a liver \u027bush to\nwash out the gallstone. This liver \u027bush should not be done if the stone is large, \nso before\ndoing the treatment it is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and\nconsult with your physician about using the treatment\n. If it is a small and recently formed\nstone, this treatment will help. If it is quite large, such as 3 to 4 mm. in diameter, then\nthe flushing treatment will not be good.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nIMPORTANT\n: This liver-\u027bushing treatment should \nnot\n be done without the\napproval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an\nAyurvedic physician. Otherwise, you may damage the gallbladder and\nexperience dangerous complications.\nCombine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2367, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7af6fc22-9456-483d-b1da-18e03ce90a1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7af6fc22-9456-483d-b1da-18e03ce90a1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70b483a0-2d83-4440-be26-f01b7be2789f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "afc7813029f9c7122106af3217d7cdaaa4aef1ad140f6d69107a2f15283f7eac"}}, "hash": "afc7813029f9c7122106af3217d7cdaaa4aef1ad140f6d69107a2f15283f7eac", "text": "\u00bc teaspoon cayenne pepper. Drink this entire mixture in the early morning (at about six\no\u2019clock) on an empty stomach. Don\u2019t eat anything until at least noon. If you feel thirsty,\ndrink hot water or a little lime juice.\nThe treatment is a shock to the gallbladder, which contracts and squeezes the\ngallstone(s) out into the duodenum.\nThat night, take \u00bd teaspoon of \ntriphala\n with warm water. The next day you will pass\nsome green stu\u0283 in the stools. This is thick, coagulated bile containing the gallstone\ncrystals.\nPREVENTION OF GALLSTONES\n. In order to prevent gallstone formation, one has to improve both\nthyroid function and metabolism. In general, the following formula is effective:\npunarnava 5 parts\nshatavari 4 parts\nkutki 2 parts\nchitrak 2 parts\nmusta 3 parts\nshilajit \u00bc part\nThis mixture (\u00bc teaspoon 3 times a day with honey), taken regularly for 2 to\n3 months, will help to prevent gallstone formation.\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Several yoga \nasanas\n are bene\u0279cial for prevention of gallstones. The Bow\npose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose (lying on the left side) will help to\nempty the gallbladder. (For illustrations \nof yoga postures, see \nappendix 4\n.) These\npostures will improve circulation in the gallbladder, helping to prevent the\ncrystallization process.\nDIET\n. Stay away from deep-fried food, dairy products such as yogurt and cheese, and\nall fatty foods, especially animal fat and any saturated fat. These accelerate coagulation\nof bile into gallstones.\n \nGas and Flatulence\n \nNo one under the sun is exempt from \u027batulence. Every person at some time or\nanother gets gases and disturbances in the colon.\nWe are all vulnerable to this condition for several reasons. First, the colon is the\nmain seat of vata dosha, the dosha that is derived from ether and air. If vata increases in\nthe colon, due to eating vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, insomnia, and\nother factors, gases may build up. Also, whenever we eat anything, we swallow a small\namount of air, which increases vata.

Grate some fresh ginger root until you have about 1 teaspoon of pulp,\nand add 1 teaspoon of lime juice. Take this mixture immediately after eating.\nLEMON JUICE REMEDY\n. Another simple method to reduce excess gas is to stir 1 teaspoon\nlemon juice and \u00bd teaspoon baking soda into 1 cup cool water. Drink it down quickly,\nright after meals, for best results! (It forms carbon dioxide, which facilitates digestion.)\nCUMIN-FENNEL-CELERY SEED MIXTURE\n. Prepare a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and \najwan\nseeds (Indian celery seed) in equal proportions. (See \nthis page\n-\nthis page\n for suggested\nmethod of preparation of roasted seeds.) After each meal, take about \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of\nthis mixture, chew well, and swallow with about \u2153 cup warm water.\nCHARCOAL TABLETS\n. Another simple remedy is charcoal tablets, which you can buy in most\nhealth food stores. Swallow two tablets after lunch and dinner. The charcoal absorbs\ngases and helps to prevent flatulence.\nHERBAL TABLETS\n. Ayurveda also suggests the herbs \nshankavati\n and \nlasunadivati\n. These herbs\nare useful for an aching stomach and are helpful to reduce \u027batulence. Take 1 tablet\n(available from most sources of Ayurvedic herbs) at night for 5 days.\nDIETARY GUIDELINES\n. Flatulence is mostly a vata condition, so following a vata-pacifying\ndiet can help prevent it. Avoid raw foods, cold food and drinks, and most beans. (See\nchapter 8\n for guidelines.) Fermented foods also increase gases in the colon, so it\u2019s best to\navoid them.\nIRIPHALA\n.\n Finally, it is helpful to take the herbal compound \ntriphala\n. At night before\ngoing to bed, steep \u00bd to 1 teaspoon \ntriphala\n \nin a cup of boiling hot water for 5 to 10\nminutes, then drink it.\n \nGlaucoma\n \nIncreasing intraocular pressure, due to accumulation of kapha dosha in the vitreous\nhumor (the viscous \u027buid inside the eyeball), is called glaucoma.

For general cleaning of the teeth and caring for the gums, Ayurvedic\ndentistry recommends the use of certain bitter and astringent herbs, particularly \nneem\n,\nwhich is bitter, and \nlodhra, kushtha\n, and \nbilva\n, which are all astringent. You can make an\nexcellent cleanser for brushing your teeth by mixing the powdered form of these herbs.\nYou can use \nneem\n plus any one of the other three, mixed in equal proportions.\nRinsing your mouth with a tea made from these herbs is also beneficial.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2352, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce6c13fd-dba1-4221-b4cc-0e47ea7e6e78": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce6c13fd-dba1-4221-b4cc-0e47ea7e6e78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c276b681-0d14-4547-ad28-e2cc116cb3ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "408e2dd048de2aa89e95d2e86e23367dca7160981813d2f865789d2467711ad5"}}, "hash": "408e2dd048de2aa89e95d2e86e23367dca7160981813d2f865789d2467711ad5", "text": "You can also buy any one of several commercial toothpastes with \nneem\n and other\nAyurvedic herbs in natural food stores or by mail order (see \nResources\n).\nFOR RECEDING GUMS\n. Receding gums expose the roots of the teeth, and then both the gums\nand teeth become sensitive to cold and more susceptible to infection. To help with this\nproblem, take a mouthful of warm sesame oil, and swish it around in your mouth for\nabout 3 minutes before going to bed. Then massage your gums with your index \u0279nger. It\nis better not to rinse with water afterward; leave the oil residue in your mouth.\nFOR BLEEDING GUMS AND GINGIVITIS\n. \nTriphala\n tea is e\u0283ective for gingivitis and bleeding gums.\nTriphala\n has astringent qualities, and it is a hemostatic\u2014that is, it stops bleeding.\nGargling and swishing the mouth with \ntriphala\n tea are helpful for both gingivitis and\nbleeding gums.\n\u2022 One cup orange juice with \u00bd teaspoon natural sugar and a pinch of cumin will help\nbleeding gums.\n\u2022 Drink the juice of \u00bd lemon squeezed into a cupful of water.\n\u2022 Raw apples are also bene\u0279cial. Eating a raw apple about an hour after meals helps\nto clean the teeth and heal the gums. Pears are also effective.\n\u2022 Eat some melon, chewing it slowly. (Again, at least an hour after meals.)\n\u2022 Try eating about 10 to 20 raspberries 2 or 3 times a day on an empty stomach.\n(Don\u2019t combine them with any dairy products.)\n\u2022 Massaging the gums with coconut oil can also help heal gingivitis and bleeding\ngums.\nFOR INFECTED GUMS\n. Tea tree oil is e\u0283ective for painful infected gums, as is clove oil. Both\nhelp to reduce pain and heal the infection. All you need is one drop of tea tree or clove\noil directly at the site of the pain. A small piece of natural, edible camphor will also take\ncare of pain in the gums. (Do not use synthetic camphor; it is poisonous.)\n\u2022 Dental \u027boss with tea tree oil will take care of infected pockets in the gums below\nthe gumline. Some dental \u027boss treated with tea tree oil is available commercially;\notherwise, just dip the floss in the oil prior to flossing.\n \nHair Care Secrets\n \nIn Ayurveda, hair (along with nails) is considered to be a by-product of bone\nformation. The \ndhatu\n or tissue responsible for building bones (\nasthi\n) also gives rise to the\nhair. (For an explanation of the \ndhatus\n, please see \nthis page\n.)\nThus, proper nutrition of the bones is necessary for healthy growth of your hair.

So the health of your hair (as well as\nyour nails) is a good indicator of the health of your bones.\nThe following Ayurvedic secrets of healthy hair will help you keep your hair\u2019s natural\nstrength and luster.\nPROPER DIET\n. Healthy hair depends \u0279rst upon eating nutritious food. Dairy products such\nas cheese, milk, and freshly prepared yogurt are good for bones and hair, as are white\nradish and daikon. Coconut, cooked apples, and cabbage are also beneficial.\nTAKE A MINERAL SUPPLEMENT\n. You can improve the condition of your hair (and also\nstrengthen your bones) by taking supplements of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other\nminerals. An effective formula will contain a daily dose of about\ncalcium\n1,200 mg.\nmagnesium\n600 mg.\nzinc\n60 mg.\nOil Massage for Hair Health and Beauty\nRubbing a little oil on your scalp is bene\u0279cial for your hair. \nAmla\n oil, \nbhringaraj\noil, and \nbrahmi\n oil are all cooling, are quite favorable for healthy growth of your\nhair, and help maintain the hair\u2019s natural luster. These oils are \u0279ne for all body\ntypes. (Please see instructions on how to prepare these oils in \nappendix 2\n.)\nBefore going to bed, rub 2 teaspoons of the oil onto your hair. Note that the\nobject here is to apply the oil to the \nscalp\n, not the hair. Gently massaging the scalp\nimproves circulation at the root of the hair and thus increases the supply of\nnourishing minerals that support the roots.\nFirst pour the oil into a small dish. (You may wish to warm it up a little.) Dip\nyour \u0279ngertips into the oil, and then run your \u0279ngers through your hair, with the\nintention of getting the oil to the scalp, not oiling the hair. \nGently\n massage from the\ncenter of your scalp (the crown of your head) down toward your ears. A rough or\nrapid application may disturb the roots of your hair.\nSESAME SEEDS\n. Every morning, eat a handful of white sesame seeds.

Gently combing your hair with a comb, a little in the\nopposite direction of its natural tendencies, helps to improve the circulation at the root\nof the hair and will make your hair healthier.\nVigorous brushing of the hair is not recommended.\nYOGA FOR YOUR HAIR\n. Several yoga postures are e\u0283ective for relieving pressure and tension\nin the neck, which will increase circulation to the scalp.

If you cannot locate \ntikta\n, you may\nsubstitute aloe vera, myrrh, or \nsudharshan\n.\n \nHeadaches\n \nHeadaches are a very complex phenomenon. Ayurveda speaks a great deal about the\netiological factors behind headaches and the many ways headaches manifest.\nGenerally, headaches are classi\u0279ed as vata type, pitta type, and kapha type. In vata\nindividuals, fear, anxiety, stress, nervousness, constipation, and physical overactivity\ncan aggravate systemic vata, which can go into the skeletal, muscular, or nervous\nsystem and cause headaches. Vata-caused headaches will tend to be in the occipital area\n(the back of the head) or on the left side.\nIn pitta individuals, acid indigestion, hyperacidity, acidic pH of the saliva and\nstomach, excess pitta in the intestine and colon, and getting overheated, as well as a\ndiet high in pitta-provoking food, can create a headache. That headache will be more in\nthe temple or temporal area.\nBecause of a kapha-producing diet, systemic kapha in the stomach increases, enters\ninto the general circulation, and can lodge in the sinuses and create kapha-type sinus\nheadaches. Kapha headaches tend to be more in the frontal and nasal areas of the head.\nHeadaches can also be due to ear problems, eye problems, insomnia, food allergies,\nexposure to cold temperatures, tension in the neck, or working too long (for instance, in\nfront of a computer) in a wrong position. Even using two pillows below the head for\nsleeping can cause headaches.\nClearly the causes are extremely varied. Remember that in Ayurveda, treatment is\ndetermined by the speci\u0279cs of each situation. Thus in order to successfully treat your\nheadache you need to know as much as possible about its cause.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2404, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd387432-ac14-4d67-afda-1682f579a3ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd387432-ac14-4d67-afda-1682f579a3ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4108bf35-7a36-4c31-8d34-93999ea1045c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "207", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "b3cc5c04c68b1b35493a532761c8a7d110fbd7ab8a05a7b453677a3fb9a25162"}}, "hash": "b3cc5c04c68b1b35493a532761c8a7d110fbd7ab8a05a7b453677a3fb9a25162", "text": "FOR VATA-TYPE HEADACHES\nThese headaches are in the back (occipital) portion of the head. They are\ncharacterized by throbbing, pulsating, migrating pain that radiates from the back of the\nhead and may go to the front. A vata headache may be associated with tension in the\nneck and shoulder muscles, back sti\u0283ness, constipation, and sciatica. This kind of\nheadache is aggravated by high altitude. It gets worse when you move your body and\nsubsides when you rest.\nWARM WATER ENEMA\n. Vata headaches are often due to toxins accumulated in the colon.\nAyurveda recommends using a warm water enema to relieve any constipation and\ntaking \ntriphala\n (\u00bd teaspoon at night with \u00bd to 1 cup warm water) over several weeks to\nsystematically detoxify the colon.\nOIL ENEMA\n. Probably the best way to pacify vata is by oil \nbasti\n (enema). Half a cup of\nwarm sesame oil injected into the rectum and retained for at least 5 to 10 minutes helps\nto calm vata. (Detailed instructions for \nbasti\n are in \nappendix 3\n.)\nOIL MASSAGE\n. For tension in the neck and shoulders, massage the tight muscles there with\nsesame oil. Then take a hot shower.\nGHEE NASYA\n. Putting 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee in each nostril will help reduce vata and\nwill be effective for soothing your headache (see \nappendix 3\n).\nNIGHTTIME FOOT AND SCALP MASSAGE\n. Before you go to sleep at night, rub some sesame oil\ngently on the top of your head and on the soles of your feet. This is one of the most\neffective ways to keep vata under control.\nIN CASE OF DEHYDRATION\n. Vata headache is frequently associated with dehydration,\nespecially if you have just gone to a higher altitude. If dehydration has occurred, make\nsome homemade dextrosaline: Mix 1 tablespoon sugar, \u00bc teaspoon salt, and about 10\ndrops of lime juice in a pint of water and drink it. The moment the dehydration is\ncorrected, a vata headache will disappear or at least be greatly reduced.\nA SOOTHING PASTE\n. If, after this treatment, the headache does not subside, then take \u00bc\nteaspoon nutmeg powder in your palm, and add su\u027dcient water to make a paste by\nrubbing your hands together. Apply the paste to your forehead. Leave it on for about\nhalf an hour and then wash it off. This should help to soothe a vata-type headache.\nFOLLOW THE VATA-BALANCING DIET\n. Remember that if you are prone to vata headaches and\nother vata-related problems such as constipation and insomnia, following a vata-\npacifying diet will help a lot (see \nchapter 8\n).\nFOR PITTA-TYPE HEADACHES\n. Pitta headaches start in the temple area and go to the central\npart of the head. A pitta headache is characterized by shooting, burning, piercing, or\npenetrating pain, and it is worsened by bright light, hot sun, or high temperatures, or by\neating sour fruits, pickles, or highly spicy food.

If you have a pitta-type headache, take 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel, up to\n3 times in a day.\nA COOLING TEA\n. Drinking cumin-coriander tea (equal amounts of each, about 1 teaspoon\nof the mixture per cup) can help to relieve a pitta-type headache. Let the tea cool to\nroom temperature before you drink it.\nA COOLING PASTE\n. This cooling paste may help to quickly relieve a pitta headache. Mix 1\nteaspoon sandalwood powder with su\u027dcient water to make a paste, and apply it to\nyour forehead and/or temples.

A few drops of warm ghee placed in the nostrils will be bene\u0279cial\nfor soothing a pitta-type headache.\nEAT SOMETHING SWEET\n. Sometimes a pitta headache responds quickly if you just have\nsomething sweet to eat. Try a piece of sweet fruit, or some ice cream.\nNIGHTTIME MINIMASSAGE\n. At night, rub a little \nbhringaraj\n oil or \nbrahmi\n oil on the soles of your\nfeet and on your scalp. Take precautions not to get oil on your pillow and sheets.\nCOVER YOUR HEAD\n. If you have a pitta-type headache\u2014or are prone to getting them\u2014don\u2019t\nwalk or work in the sun without wearing a hat. A hat on your head protects against\naggravating pitta and helps to prevent the headache.\nFOR KAPHA-TYPE HEADACHES\nIf your headache occurs in winter or spring, strikes in the morning or evening, and\ngets worse when you bend down, it is a kapha headache. It is often associated with sinus\ncongestion and clogging of the nose, and it often accompanies a cold or a cough. It may\ngo along with hay fever and other allergies. The pain of a kapha headache is usually\ndull and deep-seated. It starts in the upper frontal area of the skull, moves down to the\nforehead, and sometimes comes down to the sinuses.\nEUCALYPTUS STEAM\n. To immediately relieve a kapha headache, put 10 drops of eucalyptus\noil in boiled water, cover your head with a towel, and inhale the steam. This helps to\nrelieve the congestion and often completely takes care of the headache. Ginger steam\u2014\nboiling fresh ginger or dried ginger powder and then inhaling the steam\u2014is also\neffective.\nUSE THIS WARMING PASTE\n. A warming ginger paste can be quite helpful.

Certain yoga\npostures are also helpful, such as the Boat pose, Hidden Lotus, Bow pose, Spinal Twist,\nPalm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. (For illustrations of yoga poses see \nappendix\n4\n.) Inverted poses such as Headstand, Shoulder Stand, and the Plow pose are not\nrecommended.\n \nHearing Loss\n \nHearing is governed by an aspect of vata known as \nprana\n vata. In older people,\nprana\n vata tends to get debilitated, leading to what is known as conductive or nerve\ndeafness: The person doesn\u2019t hear properly because the nerves become weak.\nTo improve hearing, try the following natural remedies:\nTAKE YOGARAJ \nGUGGULU\n.

(Guidelines for the vata-balancing diet maybe found in \nchapter 8\n.)\nKEEP OUT OF COLD DRAFTS\n.\nTRY GARLIC OIL\n. Pour about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil into a small pan, and into it place\n1 clove of garlic, well chopped. Cook till the garlic turns brown, then let it cool. While\ncooking, press the garlic into the oil. This helps the healing properties of the garlic ooze\nout and permeate the oil. The resulting mixture, which has an excellent fragrance, is\ncalled garlic oil. Place 5 to 10 drops (of body-temperature oil) into the ear.

However, if these treatment suggestions don\u2019t result in any\nimprovement after a couple of months, or if your hearing loss seems to be\nincreasing rather than diminishing, seek a doctor\u2019s advice.\n \nHeart\u2014Ayurvedic Care\n \nAccording to Ayurveda, the heart is the seat of \nprana, ojas\n, and mind. It is a most vital\norgan. In fact, a person is as old as his or her heart. So we have to take good care of this\nprecious organ.\nIf a person has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides, and in\naddition lives a stressful life, that person runs a great risk of heart problems. So to keep\nthe heart healthy, it is important to control these factors as much as possible.\nHigh blood pressure is discussed at length in a separate section (\u201c\nHypertension\n\u201d), as\nis high cholesterol (\u201c\nCholesterol\n\u201d).

Kaphas need the most vigorous exercise, vatas the least, with pittas\nin the middle. (See \nthis page\n for further guidelines.)\nFor most people, walking at least two \nmiles a day is very bene\u0279cial. Some more\nvigorous aerobic cardiovascular exercise may also be bene\u0279cial, such as fast walking,\ngentle jogging, or jogging in place on a trampoline. (You don\u2019t need to use the large\ngymnastic trampoline; you can use the small variety, usually about 3 feet in diameter.)\nCholesterol-Reducing Foods\nSome foods may actually help to \nreduce\n cholesterol.

Meditation is one of the best ways to relax, dissolve stress, and\nallow the body to heal. By meditating for 10 to 20 minutes twice a day, a person\u2019s heart\nmay be healed. Please see \nchapter 7\n for guidelines on how to meditate.\nDO DAILY PRACTICE OF \nSAVASANA\n. \nSavasana\n is the yogic rest pose. While lying quietly, \u027bat on\nyour back with your arms by your sides, watch the \u027bow of your breath. Inhale and\nexhale, inhale and exhale.\u2026 You\u2019ll notice that after exhalation (and before inhalation),\nthere is a brief, natural stop. Similarly there is a natural stop after inhalation and before\nexhalation. In that stop, stay naturally quiet, silent, for just a few seconds.

Gold is healing for the heart. It is good for the coronary artery and is said\nto gradually reduce cholesterol. For instructions on making gold water, see \nappendix 1\n.\nHERBS FOR YOUR HEART\n. Certain Ayurvedic herbs are strengthening and healing to the heart.\n\u2022 First is the herb \narjuna\n. Take \u00bd teaspoon 3 times a day with honey and warm\nwater. \nArjuna\n does much the same thing as gold: It is a coronary vasodilator, it protects\nthe heart, it strengthens circulation, and it helps to maintain the tone and health of the\nheart muscle.\n\u2022 Ginger is also important for a healthy heart. Make fresh ginger tea by boiling a\nlittle grated or sliced ginger in a cup or two of water. Or grate a little ginger and add it\nto \nyour rice and/or your soup. Eating a little bit of ginger every day will help to prevent\nheart attack.\n\u2022 The following formula of four Ayurvedic herbs is good for the heart:\npunarnava 4 parts\nkutki 3 parts\ngulwel sattva \u00bc part\nshilajit \u00bc part\nSteep \u00bd teaspoon of this herb mixture in a cup of hot water to make a tea.\nDrinking that tea twice a day after lunch and dinner will help your heart.\n\u2022 Another simple domestic remedy to protect the heart and keep it healthy is to\ninclude a little garlic in your diet. Garlic reduces cholesterol, strengthens the circulation,\nand acts as a decongestant.\nRUDRAKSHA\n. Rudraksha\n, the \u201ctears of Shiva,\u201d are the dried seeds from the fruit of the\nrudraksha\n tree. An ancient story says that when Lord Shiva came out of deep meditation,\na few tears dropped from his eyes and fell to earth, from which sprang up the \nrudraksha\ntree. The seeds are good for the heart both physically and spiritually; they are said to be\ngood for meditation and for \u201copening the heart chakra.\u201d\nYou can wear a necklace of the beads externally, in front of the heart. Or soak a\nrudraksha\n bead overnight in water and drink the water in the morning.

Control of the sensory organs is best to\nachieve happiness, and knowledge of reality for pleasure. Among all of these,\ncelibacy is regarded as the best.\n\u201cFrom the heart, as the root, ten great vessels carry \nojas\n throughout the body. In\nits importance, the heart is to be regarded as the central supporting member of a\nhouse.\u201d\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nIMPORTANT\n: If you have any heart problems, or you are over 40, it is wise to consult\nyour physician before beginning any new exercise program.\nIf there are heart problems, the Sun Salutation may be too strenuous. In that case,\nsubstitute the following postures: Locust, Lotus, Bridge, Cow, Camel, Bow, and Cobra\nposes, Forward Bend, and Standing on One Leg\u2014the Palm Tree pose. (Illustrations of\nyoga postures appear in \nappendix 4\n.)\nBREATHING EXERCISE\n.

The breathing technique known as \nshitali pranayama\n is also\nhelpful. It is not only cooling (to combat the excess pitta) but also stimulates digestion.\n \nHemorrhoids\n \nAccording to Ayurveda, there are two basic kinds of hemorrhoids, associated with\nvata and pitta imbalances.\n\u2022 Vata hemorrhoids are small, dry, and irregular in shape and may be accompanied\nby \u0279ssures or cracking of the anus. They are rough and hard to the touch and look like\nraisins. Vata hemorrhoids may become active when the person takes antibiotics or does\na lot of cycling or physical exercise.\n\u2022 Pitta-type hemorrhoids tend to get red, irritated, and in\u027bamed and to bleed.

The internal\nkind are usually of the kapha variety and are more like polyps. They are not painful and\nare generally not problematic.\nIn most cases, hemorrhoids can be completely healed by Ayurvedic treatment, but\none must \u0279rst understand the distinction between the two basic problematic types in\norder to treat them properly.\nEFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR VATA HEMORRHOIDS\n\u2022 A person with vata hemorrhoids should follow the vata-pacifying diet. Especially, it\nis vital to keep away from the nightshade vegetables\u2014potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplant\n\u2014all of which aggravate hemorrhoids.\n\u2022 Take \ntriphala guggulu\n, 1 tablet 3 times a day.\n\u2022 Another helpful herbal formula for vata-type hemorrhoids is a combination of these\nherbs:\nhingwastak \u215b part\ndashamoola 2 parts\nTake \u00bd teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day with warm water.\n\u2022 It is important to keep the stools loose and soft, as hard stools irritate the\nhemorrhoids. Taking 1 teaspoon of \nsat isabgol\n (psyllium husks) with a glass of warm milk\nat night is beneficial for vata hemorrhoids.\n\u2022 Another way to help keep the stools soft is to take \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of \ntriphala\npowder at bedtime with warm water.\n\u2022 Prepare a warm castor oil or sesame oil pack, and sit on it for a while. Both oils are\nwarming; castor oil especially produces a slow, sustained heat that is soothing and\nhealing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of oil, and pour it onto a handkerchief or other\nsoft cloth, spreading it equally on the cloth (or dip the cloth in the oil).\nEFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR PITTA HEMORRHOIDS\n\u2022 For pitta-type hemorrhoids, the \u0279rst step is to follow the pitta-pacifying diet,\nespecially avoiding spicy and fermented foods (see \nchapter 8\n).\n\u2022 For hemorrhoids which become active and in\u027bamed and start bleeding, one should\nprepare an herbal mixture of:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e3cc049-57ac-424f-a1d8-0e20ff83973b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e3cc049-57ac-424f-a1d8-0e20ff83973b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50bc309b-6ae9-4c5a-9c8a-11c39d7855ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "1526c409d0ac30c8d50068a9c4c10a3301107c4ea6643bc9c3c73a4520419c41"}}, "hash": "1526c409d0ac30c8d50068a9c4c10a3301107c4ea6643bc9c3c73a4520419c41", "text": "guduchi 1 part\nneem 2 parts\nkama dudha \u215b part\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture twice a day with warm water.\n\u2022 If you have rectal bleeding from the hemorrhoid, drink a few ounces of cranberry\njuice and pomegranate juice (mixed half and half) between meals.

Meditation is also e\u0283ective to soothe the system and reduce stress. (See\nchapter 7\n for meditation suggestions.)\nNOTE TO MEN\n: If you know you are susceptible to herpes outbreaks, be careful\nshaving around your lips and the corners of your mouth. The lips form a delicate\nand sensitive muco-cutaneous junction that is easily injured. Any small cut or\nscratch can activate the herpes virus. To help prevent this from happening,\napply some \nneem\n oil after shaving.\n \nHiccups\n \nHiccups are caused by ischemia, or lack of blood supply to the diaphragm. As a\nresult, the diaphragm undergoes the spasmodic periodic movements that we call hiccups.\nHOLD YOUR BREATH\n. The simplest remedy for hiccups is to hold your breath. Take a deep\nbreath; hold the breath behind the belly button; then gradually exhale.\nBROWN BAG REMEDY\n. If you \u0279nd it di\u027dcult to do this, take a paper bag, open it, hold the\nedges near your nose, and breathe into the bag (both exhaling and then inhaling). This\nwill force you to inhale your own carbon dioxide, which naturally relaxes the muscles of\nthe diaphragm. Continue for 1 or 2 minutes. Your hiccups should quickly be relieved.\nHONEY AND CASTOR OIL\n. If the above procedure doesn\u2019t stop the hiccupping, mix 1 teaspoon\nhoney with 1 teaspoon castor oil. Every 2 or 3 minutes dip your index \u0279nger into the\nmixture and then lick your finger.\nDEEP BREATHING EXERCISE\n. Another simple \u2018remedy is Alternate Nostril \npranayama\n, slightly\nmodified as follows:\n1\n. \nInhale through the left nostril while closing the right nostril with your thumb.\n2\n. \nAfter inhaling, hold your breath for just a moment, then\n3\n. \nSwallow\n.\n4\n. \nExhale through your right nostril while closing the left nostril with your ring and\nlittle finger.\n5\n. \nRepeat steps 1 to 4, this time starting by inhaling through the right nostril.\nYou can do this breathing exercise for 5 minutes.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nThere are certain serious pathological hiccups, such as cardiac hiccups, which\noccur in persons having congestive heart failure; uremic hiccups, which occur\ndue to renal failure (when the kidneys do not perform their function) and the\nresulting toxicity of uric acid in the blood; and cerebral hiccups, due to cerebral", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2305, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59999ae9-8bb8-48a1-a000-afc986a3ea9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "59999ae9-8bb8-48a1-a000-afc986a3ea9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2de2fa7-8db9-4274-ae24-b972a62e9da0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "cc2ced5b8fab4b446b78f0bde7ad38fc764ee576ab4b918ecc31fb561a232254"}}, "hash": "cc2ced5b8fab4b446b78f0bde7ad38fc764ee576ab4b918ecc31fb561a232254", "text": "pathology.

But sometimes, due to various causes, the pressure\nincreases, and when it does, the person is at greater risk for heart disease and possibly\nparalyzing stroke.\nBlood pressure will increase when there is increased viscosity of the blood, increased\nvelocity, or constriction due to decreased diameter of the blood vessel.\nTYPES OF HYPERTENSION\nFrom the Ayurvedic point of view, high blood pressure falls under three categories,\nprimarily vata and pitta but also kapha.\nVata is responsible for constriction of the blood vessels. This frequently happens in\nold age. Somewhere around 65, the walls of the blood vessels often become thicker and\nthe passage becomes narrower, with the result that many individuals develop a type of\nhypertension known as essential hypertension. It is a vata condition and is di\u0283erent\nfrom the narrowing of the arteries that occurs as a result of fatty deposits on the artery\nwalls, which is a kapha condition.\nPitta is responsible for the rushing of the blood with more force. Kapha is related to\nincreased blood viscosity.\nPhysical and emotional stress, including anger and anxiety, constrict the blood\nvessels and can increase blood pressure for a time. Heavy responsibilities, or stressful\nsituations such as public speaking, may send your blood pressure soaring. There is even\na phenomenon known as \u201cwhite coat syndrome\u201d; when a person goes to the doctor,\nanxiety and tension may increase, with the result that blood pressure goes up.

And even in the long term, just\nbecause pressure is high does not necessarily mean it has to be treated with\nmedications. Entirely natural means, such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation,\nand yoga, which have no negative side e\u0283ects, may be quite su\u027dcient to deal\nwith hypertension.\nHowever, high blood pressure does require a doctor\u2019s supervision.\nHypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. I do not recommend\nthat you use the following treatments in place of standard medical care.\nRather, try these Ayurvedic remedies\u2014preferably with your doctor\u2019s\nknowledge and approval\u2014as an adjunct to your medical care, and ask your\ndoctor to monitor your progress. If the remedies are successful, he or she will\n\u0279nd less and less need to supervise your condition and keep you on medications.\nAt the least you should be able to gradually reduce the dosage of your medicines.\nFOODS FOR HYPERTENSION\nSeveral foods can help you control hypertension:\n\u2022 Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by \u00bd cup warm milk, with a\npinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (\nNote:\n If your cholesterol\nlevel is high, skip the ghee.)\n\u2022 Mix orange juice and coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut) in a\nratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut.

Drink this as many as 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood\npressure.\n\u2022 Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and a pinch of coriander added.\nThis will act as a mild diuretic and will help to regulate blood pressure.\n\u2022 Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a\nyogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking. (See the recipe in the\naccompanying sidebar.)\n\u2022 Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is\ngood for persons with hypertension.\n\u2022 Honey water can also help.

You may be able to keep your blood pressure under control by drinking\nmagnetic water. Put a cupful of water (preferably in a glass container) next to the north\npole of a magnet. Let it sit for 2 hours. Drink a cupful of magnetic water twice a day.\nCharging the water in this way increases its diuretic properties and thus helps bring\ndown high blood pressure, in the same way as several widely used current hypertension\nmedications, which are diuretics.\nRUDRAKSHA\n.\n Soak 1 or 2 \nrudraksha\n beads in a cup of water overnight, and the next day\ndrink that water. This is beneficial for regulating blood pressure.\nDeep Relaxation to Help High Blood Pressure\nTension and stress increase high blood pressure. A wonderful and e\u0283ective way\nto relax is the yogic rest pose, \nsavasana\n.\nLie quietly, \u027bat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the \u027bow of your\nbreath. You will notice that after exhalation there is a brief, natural stop, and\nanother natural pause after inhalation and before the next exhalation. In that stop,\nstay naturally quiet for just a few seconds. This practice will bring you deep\nrelaxation, a natural antidote for hypertension. Remain in \nsavasana\n practicing this\nquiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes.\nMEDITATION\n. Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure. (See \nchapter 7\n for\nguidelines to help you meditate.)

E\u0283ective yoga \nasanas\n for helping control hypertension include Yoga\nMudra and the Moon Salutation. (See the illustrations in \nappendix 4\n.)\nEXERCISE AND WORK WITH CARE\n. No one with elevated blood pressure should practice the\nHeadstand or engage in weightlifting or vigorous exercise without a physician\u2019s\nguidance.\nIMPORTANT NOTE\n: As mentioned above, hypertension may lead to serious\ncomplications. Although these Ayurvedic recommendations are time-tested, safe,\nand e\u0283ective, it would be wise to use them in conjunction with the advice and\ncare of your physician.\n \nHypoglycemia\n \nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a very common condition. If you are late to eat at\nyour regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or\nexperience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental\nconfusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a\nperson can even have convulsions and fall into coma.\nThe brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the\nnecessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn\u2019t receive su\u027dcient blood sugar, it\ngoes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the\nother symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.\nAccording to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta \nprakruti\n (a\npitta constitution) or pitta \nvikruti\n (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates\nthe secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia.\nHypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat\nand tremors.\nAn unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to\nhypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.\nHypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood\nsugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals\u2014breakfast, lunch, and dinner\u2014\nand also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel\nhypoglycemic \nsymptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main\nmeals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2492, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abc7aa03-4056-4e30-8ac5-9d422e2b47a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "abc7aa03-4056-4e30-8ac5-9d422e2b47a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb3d7c9d-c951-4bc3-ba81-1b3214e24519", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "f0bb9433a2e2dc2ba3e2a0bd7040b4d7c0455615d0b5885b919ba6570da68d52"}}, "hash": "f0bb9433a2e2dc2ba3e2a0bd7040b4d7c0455615d0b5885b919ba6570da68d52", "text": "Reactive hypoglycemia may indicate a pancreatic tumor. When a middle-\naged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that\nhe or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health\nconcern and requires medical attention.\nHypoglycemia can be classi\u0279ed into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting\nhypoglycemia simply results from not eating, which is why people with a tendency\ntoward low blood sugar need to eat regular meals. In addition, some individuals choose\nto fast, whether for religious reasons or for cleansing purposes. If they do too much\nprolonged fasting, hypoglycemia may result.\nReactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas, often in response to a large intake\nof sugar, secretes too much insulin, which then reduces the blood sugar level. This is also\ncalled postprandial (after-eating) hypoglycemia. About 90 minutes after eating, the\nblood sugar level drops, and the person craves something sweet.\nTo deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha.\nDIET\n.

Brahmi\n ghee \nnasya\n, 5 drops in each nostril, will quickly relieve nausea,\nsweating, and mental confusion (see \nappendix 3\n).\nFOR DROWSINESS\n. Drowsiness can be corrected by taking some sweet juice, such as\npomegranate or sweet orange juice.\n \nImpotence\n \nSee also \u201c\nLow Libido\n\u201d, \u201c\nPremature Ejaculation\n\u201d\nImpotence, which is a man\u2019s inability to have or to maintain an erection, may have\nseveral causes. Many people think it is always an emotional or psychological issue, but\nit can also be due to stress or to certain physical problems.\nFor example, when a person has high cholesterol, the fat and plaque may get\ndeposited on the coronary arteries, blocking the \u027bow of blood to the heart and\ntriggering a heart attack due to the insu\u027dcient blood supply. Similarly, the plaque may\nget deposited in the blood vessels leading to the penis, resulting in a \u201cpenis attack\u201d\u2014in\nwhich the blood supply to the penis is insu\u027dcient to create or sustain an erection,\nresulting in impotence.\nMASSAGE TO IMPROVE CIRCULATION\n. A simple and e\u0283ective remedy is to massage the pubic area\n(the lower part of your abdomen) and the root of the penis with a few drops of\nmahanarayan\n oil. This massage will improve the circulation and may be su\u027dcient to\neliminate the problem.\nAPPLY SOME HERBALIZED OIL\n. You can also apply some \nbala\n oil or \nashwagandha\n oil directly to\nthe penis.\nMASSAGE THE PROSTATE AREA\n. Massaging above the prostate gland (midway between the\nscrotum and the anus) with any of the three oils mentioned above will also be beneficial.\nIf you do not have these oils, you can just use a little plain ghee. First rub in a circular\nmotion, then \u0279nish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the penis. Use a light\npressure. Like the massage of the pubic area, this will help improve circulation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2331, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d1f0ac0-663d-43b4-8b99-57ade18a227d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d1f0ac0-663d-43b4-8b99-57ade18a227d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e994f7e-3c16-46a4-826f-7c9bba82ab55", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "bbbb398e3bdc99459ca1750d56732da2de0534be7d667aae1df0f17531549c7f"}}, "hash": "bbbb398e3bdc99459ca1750d56732da2de0534be7d667aae1df0f17531549c7f", "text": "STRENGTHENING HERBAL FORMULA\n.

(See \nchapter 8\n for a chart of incompatible food\ncombinations.)\nThese various factors promote excess secretion of acid, leading to acid indigestion,\nheartburn, nausea, or even diarrhea; fermentation of the food in the stomach or\nintestines may also occur, leading to gas, bloating, and a possible stomachache,\ndepending on the severity of the cause.\nSo one has to deal with indigestion \u0279rst by avoiding these causative factors, and\nsecond by using the herbal treatments recommended below.\nFOUR WAYS TO INCREASE YOUR DIGESTIVE FIRE\nThe \u0279rst key to prevention of indigestion is to enhance the digestive \u0279re. Here are\nseveral suggestions:\nGINGER\n. One of the best herbs to kindle agni is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate\na little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and chew it up.\nAlternatively, you can simply cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew\nthat.\nGARLIC AND \nTRIKATU\n. Here is another before-eating stimulant for your digestion. Make a\nmixture of \u00bc teaspoon garlic powder, \u00bd teaspoon \ntrikatu\n, and a pinch of rock salt.\n(\nTrikatu\n is composed of ginger, black pepper, and Indian long pepper in equal\nproportions.) Take it before lunch and dinner.\nHERBAL MIX\n. A similar mixture is 1 clove of fresh garlic, chopped up with \u00bc teaspoon\ncumin powder, a pinch of rock salt, a pinch of \ntrikatu\n, and 1 teaspoon lime juice. Take\nbefore meals.\nBAY LEAF\n. Enliven your gastric \u0279re with the common spice bay leaf. Steep \u00bd teaspoon\ncrushed or ground-up bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea.\nAdd a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.\nFASTING\nFasting can be bene\u0279cial to dispel indigestion. Fasting not only kindles the digestive\n\u0279re, it also gives the digestive system a rest. When you have indigestion, you can either\nobserve a complete fast, or try this: Drink 1 cup of sweet fresh pineapple juice with a\npinch of ginger, a pinch of black pepper, and \u00bd teaspoon organic sugar. Take this 3\ntimes a day.\nWHEN YOU HAVE INDIGESTION", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5031cf0-1242-40da-ac3a-36009c2fe890": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5031cf0-1242-40da-ac3a-36009c2fe890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da5cfc3c-d9a6-4270-973a-662f72a16dc5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "228", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "55761b0896ecdb713978cc71f59ec4a63027ac9419441c99cd5711b8c240d218"}}, "hash": "55761b0896ecdb713978cc71f59ec4a63027ac9419441c99cd5711b8c240d218", "text": "To relieve a case of indigestion:\nONION JUICE\n.

Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.\n\u2022 Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid\nsnacking between meals.\n\u2022 Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive\nfire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.\n\u2022 Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid,\nleaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.\n\u2022 Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major\nrole in digestion.\n\u2022 You can \u0279nish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4\nteaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.\n\u2022 Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the\nPeacock pose.

Traveling on a jet at a\ntremendous speed induces a light, mobile, and spacy quality in the system, which\naggravates vata. To prevent jet lag, Ayurveda suggests the following three-part strategy:\n1\n. \nAn hour before flying\n, swallow 2 capsules (00 size) of ginger, with a cup of water.\n2\n. \nWhile on the plane\n, drink at least 2 to 3 cups of water, at intervals of 1 to 2 hours.\nFlying creates a slight dehydration of the body, which can be corrected by drinking\nsu\u027dcient liquid. Dehydration increases vata. Don\u2019t drink co\u0283ee or any other\ncaffeinated beverage caffeine also provokes \nvata\n.\n3\n. \nWhen you reach your destination\n, rub a little warm sesame oil on your scalp and on\nthe soles of your feet. Also, drink 1 cup of hot milk with a pinch each of nutmeg and\nginger. These two simple actions will help pacify vata.\nIf you reach your destination before nightfall, you can drink a tea made of equal\nproportions of chamomile, mint, and \njatamamsi\n (\u2153 teaspoon each), steeped in a cup of\nhot water for 10 minutes.\nIf you don\u2019t expect to have herbs available where you are going, you can mix them at\nhome and take them with you in a small plastic sandwich bag or other convenient\ncontainer.\n \nKidney Problems\n \n", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2078, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c81366e9-6825-43dc-ac2b-6c43a5d7fad6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c81366e9-6825-43dc-ac2b-6c43a5d7fad6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79731938-a383-453b-a103-178eaf262e9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "26c8704298e91f5dc652914bafdd31716dbb70bed79e503b560d001669fe183c"}}, "hash": "26c8704298e91f5dc652914bafdd31716dbb70bed79e503b560d001669fe183c", "text": "See also \u201c\nKidney Stones\n\u201d\nCongestion, high pitta, or crystal urea in the kidney, as well as kidney stones, can all\ncreate tightness and pain in the lower back area. For these problems, Ayurveda suggests\nthe following simple remedies.\nFirst, prepare a mixture of these herbs:\npunarnava 1 part\ngokshura 1 part\nfennel seed 1 part\nTake 1 full teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day after meals, washing it\ndown with warm water.\nAnother simple, natural treatment for kidneys is cumin-coriander-fennel tea. Prepare\nthe tea by mixing equal amounts of these herbs, boil in water, and drink 2 or 3 times a\nday. (Use about \u00bc teaspoon of each herb per cup of water.)\nFor another e\u0283ective remedy, combine about \u00bd teaspoon of the Ayurvedic herb\nmusta\n with \u00bd teaspoon fennel, steep in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes, strain, and\ndrink. This drink will strengthen the kidneys.\n \nKidney Stones\n \nThere are di\u0283erent types of kidney stones, corresponding to vata, pitta, and kapha\ndosha.\n\u2022 Calcium stones are kapha stones. They are generally soft and painless, though they\nmay become painful when they start leaving the pelvis of the kidney and enter the\nureter. An individual with an underactive thyroid or parathyroid gland can develop\ncalcium stones.\n\u2022 Phosphate stones are rough; they irritate the bladder and cause pain because of\ntheir rough quality. They are primarily caused by increased phosphates in the system,\ndue to excess eating of nightshade plants (potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes).\n\u2022 Oxalate stones are sharp. They are pitta stones. They irritate, burn, and create\nbleeding, and they may create a great deal of pain from loin to groin. A diet high in\noxalic acid promotes formation of pitta stones. Thus individuals who eat spinach,\npotato, tomato, and rhubarb, which are rich in oxalic acid, have a tendency to form\nstones.

According to Ayurveda, this desire\nderives from \nshukra dhatu\n, the male reproductive tissue, and \nartava dhatu\n, the female\nreproductive tissue. When there is weakness or debility in the male or female\nreproductive tissue, libido is low.\nLow libido is a symptom that many people have in middle age or even earlier.

It can be e\u0283ectively treated with Ayurvedic\nprograms and remedies that reduce stress and strengthen the reproductive system.\nBut as always in Ayurveda, the question arises, What is the total context of the\nsituation? Low libido can be a problem that a\u0283ects ones marriage or partnership. On the\nother hand, reduced sexual desire may sometimes be a healthy response by the body,\nshutting o\u0283 excess loss of the health-giving vital \u027buid. From this perspective, low libido\nmay be seen as an expression of the body\u2019s intelligence.\nIntentional celibacy is quite di\u0283erent from low libido. In celibacy there is incredible\nsexual power, but the person consciously controls that sexual energy and transforms it\ninto supreme bliss or supreme intelligence.\nIn cases of low libido, that energy is simply lacking. In this section we will explore\nseveral ways to increase it.\nFOR MEN\nA simple but e\u0283ective technique is to gently press the glans penis (the head or tip of\nthe penis) with the top of your index \u0279nger. Speci\u0279cally, press on the groove about one\ninch behind the tip of the penis. A \nmarma\n point is located at the center of that groove.\n(See \nglossary\n for a brief explanation of \nmarma\n points.) Gently press for a minute or two,\nthen release. This technique will also help remedy premature ejaculation. (See further\nsuggestions under \u201c\nPremature Ejaculation.\n\u201d)\n\u2022 You can also gently massage the glans penis with \nbala\n oil or \nshatavari\n ghee. Or\napply a little castor oil or \nbrahmi\n ghee. (See \nappendix 2\n for guidance in preparing\nherbalized oils and ghees.)\n\u2022 Internally, taking the herb \nashwagandha\n is e\u0283ective. Add 1 teaspoon \nashwagandha\nand \u00bd teaspoon \nvidari\n to a cup of warm milk, and drink it at night. This formula is\nstrengthening for men with low libido. NOTE: It is better to cook the herbs in the milk\nfor a few minutes than to just mix the powder in the cup.\nFOR WOMEN\nA similar herbal formula is helpful for women, but use \nshatavari\n instead of\nashwagandha\n. Mix 1 teaspoon \nshatavari\n with \u00bd teaspoon \nvidari\n, and take it with a cup of\nwarm milk at night before going to bed.\n\u2022 You can also gently massage the pubic bone with \nbala\n oil, \nshatavari\n ghee, castor oil,\nor \nbrahmi\n ghee.\nFOOD REMEDIES FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2377, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01002658-c1b5-42fd-8d0f-0503e8b1a3e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "01002658-c1b5-42fd-8d0f-0503e8b1a3e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "271bad3f-a557-408c-b7ff-104bc0fd3060", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "235", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "1c89e3f1fa4ae20ac21acab9a0b429e8125c78c228c18f4eb0adac9b06439a79"}}, "hash": "1c89e3f1fa4ae20ac21acab9a0b429e8125c78c228c18f4eb0adac9b06439a79", "text": "ALMONDS\n.

Most memory problems are due either\nto stagnation of kapha or to aggravation of vata dosha, with its light, airy, even spacy\nqualities. Thus, in order to improve memory, we need to control vata and kapha. Pitta,\non the other hand, is sharp and penetrating and supports good memory.\nThe following recommendations will help you improve your memory and prevent\nmemory loss.\nMEMORY FOODS\nCARROTS\n. Carrots, which contain carotene, are good for memory. Carrots also enhance\npitta, which brings sharpness of recall. Drink \ncarrot or beet juice, both of which are\nblood builders and will help improve memory.\nKITCHARI FAST\n.

Write down important information in order to remember it. Then you\ncan go over it, and over it. Also, make a list of things you want to do or buy. Then you\nwon\u2019t forget the milk or bananas!\nDEVELOP A POETIC ATTITUDE\n. Think in rhymes and rhythms. In the oral traditions of India and\nother countries, students memorize vast amounts of knowledge that is usually set in\nrhyme and rhythm.\nASSOCIATE\n. Use association to aid memory. Suppose somebody tells you his name. Try to\nassociate that name with something familiar. You might even imagine a picture to go\nalong with the sound.\nMEDITATION ON FORGETFULNESS\n. There is an ancient Vedic technique to recapture a lost\nmemory: If you forget something, just sit quietly and stay in the forgetfulness. Breathe\ninto the forgetfulness, and try to dig out the memory. Suddenly it will come back!\nOTHER REMEDIES\nEXERCISE\n. Daily walking, especially fast walking if you are \u0279t for it, improves\ncirculation and helps strengthen memory. Walk for half an hour, 5 times a week,\nMonday to Friday.\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Yoga postures are helpful, especially the inverted poses (Shoulder Stand,\nHeadstand, Plow pose, and Camel pose), which help to bring more blood to the brain.\nThe Bow and Cobra poses are also helpful, as is Savasana, the yogic rest pose. Also do\nthe Sun Salutation, 12 cycles a day.\nOIL MASSAGE\n. \nBrahmi\n oil rubbed on the soles of the feet and on the scalp stimulates\ncerebral neural receptors under the skin, which send messages to the brain cells and can\nactivate memory.\nNASYA\n.\n The nose is the doorway to the brain and memory. Nose drops of warmed-up\nbrahmi\n ghee, 5 drops in each nostril, can help to improve memory.

Try the Empty Bowl or \nSo-\nHum\n meditation explained in \nchapter 7\n.\nAVOID TOXIC SUBSTANCES\n. A person who has memory problems should avoid alcohol and\nmarijuana. Also, strictly avoid drugs that will directly a\u0283ect the brain, such as LSD.\nSmoking cigarettes can also adversely a\u0283ect memory, as nicotine toxicity constricts the\ncerebral blood vessels, which will damage the brain cells. Some research indicates that\ncertain commonly prescribed medications, such as diazepam (Valium), may also\nseriously impair memory.\nThese do\u2019s and don\u2019ts will be effective in protecting and improving your memory.\n \nMenopause Problems\n \nMenopause is a natural phenomenon. The body stops producing female hormones,\nand menstruation ceases. In addition to their reproductive and other functions, female\nhormones are necessary for regulation of bone metabolism. That is why some women\nmay end up with osteoporosis. This is particularly true of vata and pitta individuals.\n(See \u201c\nOsteoporosis\n\u201d for suggestions on preventing this condition.)\nSome women may experience menopausal syndrome, characterized by hot \u027bashes,\nretention of water, and mood swings. Some may have insomnia. The following\nrecommendations will help you move through this natural stage of your life gracefully\nand comfortably.\nDIETARY GUIDELINES\n. The main dietary recommendation for menopause is to follow the\nvata-pacifying diet (see \nchapter 8\n). This is true for all constitutions but is especially\ncrucial for vata types.\nALOE VERA\n. Taking fresh aloe vera gel (1 teaspoon 3 times a day) will help prevent and\nrelieve uncomfortable symptoms.\nMINERAL SUPPLEMENTS\n. It is important to take some mineral supplements.

Try drinking 1 cup of pomegranate juice with 1 teaspoon rock candy\npowder or organic sugar and 5 to 10 drops of lime juice. You can drink this 2 or 3 times\nper day, as needed to relieve hot flashes.\nFOR VAGINAL DRYNESS\n. To alleviate vaginal dryness, you can pour some sesame oil on a\npiece of sterile cotton, mold it into a tamponlike shape, and insert it into the vagina at\nnight. Use a sanitary pad to catch any leakage of the oil. (Consider tying a clean thread\nor string to the cotton to help you remove it in the morning.)\nHELPFUL YOGA POSTURES\n.

More pain before the onset of menstruation, bloating, lower abdominal pain,\nlower back ache, constipation, cramps, and insomnia are associated with vata-type\ndysmenorrhea. Menstrual flow tends to be scanty.\n\u2022 \nPitta\n. Congestive dysmenorrhea is a pitta problem. Pitta creates congestion,\nin\u027bammation, and irritation. The breasts become tender, the bladder becomes sensitive,\nand there can be a burning sensation while passing urine. There may be hot \u027bashes and\nirritability. It may lead to profuse menstrual flow.\n\u2022 \nKapha\n. In kapha-type menstrual di\u027dculties, there is also congestion, and pain\noccurs more in the later part of the menstrual period, associated with white discharge,\nbloating, water retention, feelings of heaviness, lethargy, and drowsiness. The woman\nfeels like sleeping during the daytime.\nTREATMENTS FOR DYSMENORRHEA\nNow for some effective treatments for each type of disorder.\nVATA\n.

Remember, you are not a trained Ayurvedic diagnostician.\nSimply reassess the situation and try a different line of treatment.\nFOR ALL BODY TYPES\nHERBAL REMEDIES\n. Ayurvedic medicine includes a series of powerful herbal compounds\nbased on the herb \nguggulu\n. In addition to other healing qualities, these compounds are\nespecially good for regulating menstruation. For vata-type pain, use \ntriphala guggulu\n or\nyogaraj guggulu\n. Pittas may use \nkaishore guggulu\n. Kaphas will do best with \npunarnava\nguggulu\n. In each case, take one tablet twice a day. These tablets are generally available\nfrom sources of Ayurvedic herbs (see \nResources\n).\n\u2022 Another universal remedy that should bring some relief from menstrual pain is to\nroast some cumin seeds in an ungreased pan until they smell pungent. (It will just take a\nfew minutes.) When they are cool, chew about 1 teaspoon slowly, and follow with one\ntablespoon aloe vera juice.\nFOR EXCESSIVE MENSTRUAL FLOW\n. A tea made of raspberry leaves and hibiscus \u027bowers (equal\namounts, 1 to 2 teaspoons of herbs per cup of water) is often quite effective.\n\u2022 You might also try drinking a cup of coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh\ncoconut) with \u00bd teaspoon rock candy powder or natural sugar added.\n\u2022 Eating about 10 to 20 fresh raspberries on an empty stomach, up to 2 or 3 times a\nday, may be helpful.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2077, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7096850-0f72-4d69-9097-18c892100c40": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7096850-0f72-4d69-9097-18c892100c40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11006449-0b6f-4f4e-bd3e-b0871fa806e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "244", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "978535dc540d90eb82ce00a23c88ef73f7c1f336e9215a6fe2b70b1d149a6f77"}}, "hash": "978535dc540d90eb82ce00a23c88ef73f7c1f336e9215a6fe2b70b1d149a6f77", "text": "STRATEGY TO PREVENT MENSTRUAL PROBLEMS\nPerhaps more important than all these pain remedies is a strategy to \nprevent\nmenstrual problems.

For the entire week before you expect your period to start, take 1\ntablespoon of aloe vera gel, 3 times a day. This will help prevent all types of menstrual\npain and discomfort.\nDIETARY GUIDELINES\n. Throughout the month, follow the dietary guidelines for your\nconstitutional type (see \nchapter 8\n).\nYOGA POSITIONS\n. Throughout the month, spend a few minutes every day on the yoga\npostures recommended for your body type (see \nthis page\n). Yoga \nasanas\n are not\nrecommended during the menstrual period. Just rest, read, and relax as much as\npossible.\nIf you follow these recommendations, your menstrual problems may soon be nothing\nbut a memory.\n \nMigraine\n \nSee also \u201c\nHeadaches\n\u201d\nAlthough migraine headaches can result from a vata, pitta, or kapha imbalance, they\nmost frequently occur when systemic pitta moves into the cardiovascular system,\ncirculates, and a\u0283ects the blood vessels around the brain. The hot, sharp quality of pitta\ndilates the blood vessels and creates pressure on the nerves, causing this painful\ncondition.\nFOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET\n. To treat migraine headaches, it is vital \u0279rst to take care of\npitta with a proper pitta-soothing diet. (See the dietary guidelines in \nchapter 8\n.)\nEspecially avoid hot, spicy foods, fermented foods, and sour or citrus fruits. Carefully\nfollowing a pitta-soothing diet is e\u0283ective both for migraine relief and as a preventive\nmeasure.\nPREVENTIVE BREAKFAST\n. Certain individuals get migraines at midday, which then subside\nlater in the evening. For such individuals, try this preventive method. It may sound too\nsimple, but it is e\u0283ective. First thing in the morning, take 1 ripe banana. Peel it, chop it\ninto pieces, and add 1 teaspoon warm ghee, 1 teaspoon date sugar, and a pinch of\ncardamom on top. This is delicious, and it will help to reduce pitta and prevent a\nheadache from arising.\nHERBAL REMEDY\n.

Because migraine headaches are predominantly a pitta disorder, they\nare a\u0283ected by the hot sun. When the sun rises, its hot, sharp, penetrating rays increase\npitta in the cardiovascular system and cause the dilation of the blood vessels in the\nbrain, which results in the painful headaches. So it is important to avoid direct exposure\nto the sun, and if you do go out in the sun, wear a hat.\nSOOTHING NOSE DROPS\n. Once a headache has developed, putting about 5 drops of warm\nbrahmi\n ghee in each nostril will help relieve the pain.\nRECOMMENDED YOGA POSTURES\n. Generally, a person having migraines should do the Moon\nSalutation (see \nappendix 4\n). Helpful yoga postures include the Hidden Lotus, Boat pose,\nBow pose, Spinal Twist, Palm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes.\nA COOLING \nPRANAYAMA\n. You will also find a cooling breathing exercise such as \nshitali\n helpful\n(see \nchapter 8\n).\nA HEALING YAWN\n. When you have a migraine, gently squeeze your earlobes, \npulling the\near down, and do the act of yawning.

This condition is due to\naggravation of pitta and is especially common among pitta individuals. It usually occurs\nfrom approximately the sixth to the tenth week of pregnancy.\nSome medical researchers have said that the level of estrogen in the blood rises\nduring pregnancy. Estrogen is pittagenic. The higher estrogen level in the blood triggers\npitta in the stomach and increases acid secretion, so that the stomach becomes more\nacidic.

During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s sense\nof smell becomes unusually sensitive. The reason is interesting. According to Ayurveda,\nthe earth element is particularly prominent during pregnancy, because the fetus is\nbuilding and growing and the earth element is responsible for solidity and structure. The\nearth element is also associated with the sense of smell. (In Ayurveda, the senses are\nrelated to the elements like this: Space = touch; Air = hearing, Fire = sight; Water =\ntaste, Earth = smell.)\nAyurvedic literature talks poetically about morning sickness, saying that it is\ncommon among women whose babies will develop a copious head of hair after birth.\nSTART THE DAY WITH A LITTLE FOOD\n. Believe it or not, the \u0279rst thing to do upon waking up in\nthe morning is to put something in your stomach. Have a little light food. You might try\nsome crackers with a slightly salty taste. Salt is generally pitta-provoking, but a small\nquantity of salt stimulates salivary secretion and helps to reduce pitta. Fresh lime juice is\nalso helpful, with a little salt and sugar.\nEAT OFTEN\n. If you are troubled by morning sickness, eat small frequent meals, as many\nas \u0279ve or six in a day. An empty stomach has more acid secretion, and irritation and\nnausea easily follow.\nCOCONUT WATER\n. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to a cup of coconut water (the natural\njuice inside a fresh coconut), and take a sip every 15 minutes to settle your stomach.\nEFFECTIVE HERBAL REMEDY\n.

Pregnant mothers need both. And they settle the stomach.\nWALK IT OFF\n. Sometimes walking in the fresh morning air helps with morning sickness,\nbecause fresh cool air reduces pitta. It also helps to relieve stress. It sometimes happens\nthat a pitta woman, working for a demanding boss and coming home to a criticizing\nhusband, develops some unresolved anger.

Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then\ntake a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called \nabhyanga\n) will minimize\nstress and help with morning sickness.\nMILK WITH ROSE WATER\n. Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling\nnauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. (You\ncan just as well use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk.) This will\nhelp to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk\nwith a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning\nsickness.\nDRINK A LOT\n.

Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons\nsugar, the juice of \u00bd lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2\nhours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.\nPEACOCK FEATHER ASH\n. This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite e\u0283ective. Ayurvedic\nliterature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash.\nBurn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash.

They may be due to insu\u027dcient\nblood supply to the muscle or, in some cases, to excess blood supply, as in the case of\n\u201cwriter\u2019s cramp.\u201d Muscle spasms can be due to lack of calcium in the diet or\nmalabsorption of calcium, since calcium plays a significant role in relaxing the muscle. A\nrelated problem is hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid), in which the person\nloses calcium; this may also cause the muscles to undergo spasm. Exposure to cold and\npoor circulation may also be responsible.\nThe Ayurvedic understanding is, in simplest terms, that muscle spasms are caused by\nvata dosha.

If\nthere is a spasm in the upper body, such as in the arms or \u0279ngers, grab hold of your\nupper lip, in the middle, between your thumb and index \u0279nger. If the spasm is in the\nlegs or the lower part of the body, grab the lower lip.\nThese energy points on the lips send messages to the brain, which in turn relays a\nsignal to the motor system to relax the muscles. Just grabbing the lips for 30 seconds\nshould help relieve the spasm. Press fairly strongly, but not hard enough to be painful.\nCONTRACT AND RELAX THE MUSCLE\n. Repeatedly alternate contraction and relaxation of the\nmuscle. This will improve circulation and help to release lactic acid, which will relax the\nmuscle.\nMASSAGE\n. Another approach is to apply a little oil to the muscle belly and gently\nmassage. \nMahanarayan\n oil is best if you have it; otherwise, some sesame oil or other oil\nwill do. Gentle massage of the painful cramped muscle will relax the muscle \u0279bers,\nimprove the circulation, and pacify the vata. That will help relieve the spasm.\nAfter rubbing in the \nmahanarayan\n oil, apply a little heat. For best results, use a hot\nwater bottle (not an electric heating pad).\nWinter, with its dry, cold weather, is vata season. During winter season, when vata\nindividuals get exposed to the cold, their muscles may cramp. Rubbing the muscle with\nmahanarayan\n oil (or sesame oil) and hen applying heat will be soothing and healing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2679, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13ef79c8-b184-4920-9402-898504cb9067": {"__data__": {"id_": "13ef79c8-b184-4920-9402-898504cb9067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0cca689f-eb00-4c4a-9ea0-e8348f8a717a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "2bdf3e1b86c83952f6a60c3d485301633d0df3e0bdbd138765261e03f52a9df8"}}, "hash": "2bdf3e1b86c83952f6a60c3d485301633d0df3e0bdbd138765261e03f52a9df8", "text": "SOAK IT\n.

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may\nbe related. Muscle pain can happen anywhere in the body, in the skeletal muscles as\nwell as in the smooth muscles of the abdomen. As with spasm in the arm or leg,\nabdominal cramps may have many causes, such as eating too big a meal, or lifting too\nheavy a weight, which strains the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach,\nconstipation, or acid indigestion can also create cramps in the stomach or abdomen.\n\u2022 For painful cramps in the abdominal muscles, take the herbal compound \nshankavati\n(one 200-mg. tablet after dinner).\n\u2022 This antacid formula may also be effective:\nshatavari \u00bd teaspoon\nguduchi \u00bc teaspoon\nshanka bhasma pinch\nTake this entire amount once or twice a day, after meals.\n\u2022 Warm milk is helpful for abdominal muscle cramps.

As a result, they may\ndevelop rhinitis, with nasal congestion and nasal discharge. Even in the absence of\ninfection, dryness in the atmosphere may dry up the mucous membranes and nasal\npassage; to compensate for that, the body will produce more mucus. Then, due to\ncontinuing dry heat in the environment, the nasal discharge becomes thick, dry, and\ncrusty. This is known as nasal crust.\nPeople with deviated nasal septum can also accumulate nasal discharge, and because\nof dryness in the air it may form a crust. Nasal crust can create stu\u0283y nose, sinus\nheadache, and di\u027dculty breathing. It can be one of the causes of snoring and of sleep\napnea. Nosebleeds may also be due to nasal crust.\nAyurvedic medicine offers a number of effective remedies:\nSTEAM IT\n. The simplest remedy is to inhale steam. You can use plain water, water with\nsome ginger boiled in it, or a tea of the following ingredients:\nginger\najwan (Indian celery seed)\nturmeric\nPut equal amounts of each of these herbs in a pint of water, and boil it up.\nThen turn o\u0283 the \u0279re, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam.

So it is important\nnot to feed the child\u2019s imagination with disturbing images. Keep children busy with\ncreative play; don\u2019t let them watch violent or horrifying television programs or read\nfrightening stories.\nThe child\u2019s room should be pleasant and \u0279lled with sweetness, with nice music and\nperhaps some tinkling bells. Bells have a happy sound that children like. You can tell the\nchild, \u201cWhen there is a bell, monsters won\u2019t come.\u201d And they\u2019ll sleep peacefully.\nRather than watching frightening or violent movies, tell children positive, uplifting\nstories, such as from the \nRamayana\n, about baby Krishna, or any other beautiful, happy\nstory.\nGive the child a mini\u2013oil massage before bed. Rub some oil, especially \nbrahmi\n oil or\nbhringaraj\n oil, on the soles of the feet and on the scalp. This will help relax the child. (See\nappendix 2\n for instructions on making herbalized oils.)\nSometimes nightmares come as a result of bedwetting. To help prevent this, see that\nthe child doesn\u2019t drink much for at least two \nhours before going to sleep.

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the\ndreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping,\n\u027bying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued,\nbeing locked up\u2014these are vata dreams.\n\u2022 Pitta dreams. These dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as\nteaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta\ndreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.\n\u2022 Kapha dreams. Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water \u0279gures\nprominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus \u027bowers, swans,\nand elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning,\nor seeing oneself as dead, are \u201cnegative\u201d aspects of the kapha dream repertory.\nEAT EARLY\n. Eat dinner before seven o\u2019clock. Eating too late at night may create\nnightmares.\nCUT DOWN ON STRESS\n.

Trauma to the nose, extreme dryness of the\nnasal passage so that the nasal mucous membranes crack and bleed, allergies, rhinitis, a\nnasal polyp, or high blood pressure may all cause nosebleed. Going to a high altitude or\nconsuming excess alcohol are also possible causes.\nUsually we don\u2019t have any time to investigate the cause; we need to treat it\nimmediately. Here are several effective remedies:\nDRINK COOL WATER\n. This alone will stop many nosebleeds.\nUSE A COLD COMPRESS\n. Dip a handkerchief or any clean soft cloth into cold water, and place\nit on the forehead and the nose. Then \ngently\n blow the nose so that the clot, if there is\none, comes out. (If there is a dry nasal crust, it will irritate the nasal passage and cause\nbleeding.)\nSNIFF COLD WATER\n. Take a little cool water in your palm, inhale it up into the nose, and\ngently blow the nose.\nSQUEEZE YOUR NOSE\n. If the cold water doesn\u2019t stop the bleeding, then pinch the nose with\nyour thumb and index \u0279nger, as if you were about to dip under water. Hold for 2 or 3\nminutes, breathing normally through the mouth. That should stop the bleeding.\nGHEE OINTMENT\n. If the bleeding still doesn\u2019t stop, another simple remedy is to put a\ncouple of drops of lukewarm ghee in each nostril. Dip a cotton swab into a jar of ghee,\nand apply it to the nose. Ghee is hemostatic\u2014that is, it stops bleeding.\nSTAND OR SIT UPRIGHT\n. Don\u2019t lie down, which will encourage bleeding. Also don\u2019t do any\ninverted yoga postures such as Headstand, \nShoulder Stand or Plow. Remaining upright\nwill minimize bleeding.\nHUMIDIFY YOUR SURROUNDINGS\n. Many nosebleeds are due to a dry nose, caused by hot, dry\nair. So as a preventive measure in dry climates or in winter when heating the house can\ncreate a lot of dry air, be sure to humidify your bedroom, workroom, or the entire living\nspace. It is better not to use an ultrasound humidifier; a hot water unit is best.\nHERBAL REMEDY\n. Orally, take a mixture of:\nmanjistha \u2153 teaspoon\nkama dudha \u215b teaspoon\nTake this mixture with a little warm water twice a day.\nJUICE CURE\n.

You may have a\nserious health problem. The bleeding may be due to high blood pressure, which\nneeds to be cared for. Or it could possibly be caused by leukemia, a type of blood\ncancer.\nFOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET\n. According to Ayurvedic principles, even though nosebleed\nhas some vata symptoms, such as dryness and cracking of the nasal passages, it is\nessentially a pitta disorder, in which pitta becomes hot and sharp and causes the\nbleeding. So when you have a nosebleed, don\u2019t eat hot and spicy foods, abstain from\nalcohol and cigarettes, and don\u2019t work under the hot sun. These are all pitta-provoking.\n \nObesity\n \nObesity is a condition in which an individual is signi\u0279cantly overweight, and an\nexcessive amount of body fat has accumulated under the chin and on the breasts, belly,\nbuttocks, and/or thighs. Though it is not a serious disease in itself, it may shorten the\nspan of life, as well as create diminished e\u027dciency and a predisposition to diabetes,\nhypertension, low libido, and arthritis. Ultimately, obesity reduces happiness.\nTo a great extent, obesity is due to the socioeconomic problems of an a\u0280uent\nsociety. A prosperous life, a sedentary job, and lack of exercise are the major\ncontributors to obesity. From an Ayurvedic point of view, the main causes of this\ncondition are eating too much, sitting too much, and doing too little.\nObesity is a kapha disorder. In obese individuals the gastric \u0279re is strong, but the\ncellular \u0279re in the tissue is relatively low. \nWhatever excess food or calories a person\nconsumes are not burned and instead turn into adipose tissue, leading to overweight and\nobesity.\nThere are numerous other potential causes. Certain hereditary factors of the\nendocrine system, such as excess production of growth hormone, may contribute to the\ncondition. When women are pregnant, they may eat too much and be unable to lose the\nweight afterward. Stress may induce repeated emotional eating, leading to signi\u0279cant\nweight gain. Frequent munching between meals is also detrimental to maintaining a\nhealthy weight. Certain drugs, including steroids and oral contraceptives, can change\nthe metabolism and produce weight gain, as can insulin.

But the main factor is usually eating\ntoo much, along with insufficient exercise.\nHabitually drinking cold drinks and eating fatty fried foods, dairy products such as\ncheese, yogurt, and ice cream, and consuming excess sugar and carbohydrates are all\ncausative factors.\nWATCH YOUR DIET\n. In treating obesity, the \u0279rst step is to control what you eat. Follow the\nkapha-pacifying diet (see guidelines in \nchapter 8\n). Avoid habitually drinking cold drinks\nand eating fatty fried foods. Minimize dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and ice\ncream. Be sure to include salad (without creamy dressings) and beans in your meals.\nDrink hot water instead of ice-cold drinks. Obese people generally hate hot water, but\nthey should drink it, either plain or in herbal teas such as ginger, mint, or cinnamon.\nIf you like to eat meat, you can have some \u0279sh or chicken once a month, but no beef,\nlamb, or pork.\nGET ADEQUATE EXERCISE\n. Do some regular exercise. A daily walk of at least half an hour is\nessential. And do some aerobic exercise, such as gentle jogging. Obese people hate\njogging, but they should at least walk fast, carrying 2.5-pound hand-held weights.\nSwimming is also good exercise.\nLift weights to reduce body weight. Do some gentle weight lifting, using 5-pound\nweights to get started. This will help to burn adipose tissue. Also, muscle tissue burns\ncalories more quickly than fat.\nIf you want to lose weight, you must understand some simple arithmetic. When you\ntake in more calories than you burn o\u0283, you will gain weight. In order to lose weight,\nyou \nmust\n burn o\u0283 more calories than you take in. In practical terms, this means two\nthings: reducing your caloric intake, and increasing your output in the form of exercise.\nFollow the kapha-reducing diet, and increase the amount of exercise you do every day.\nYOUR POSTEXERCISE PRESCRIPTION\n. Immediately after exercise, kapha individuals will feel\nhungry and thirsty and will want to rush to the restaurant to have a cold drink and a\nbite to eat. But the cold drink will slow down the metabolism, defeating the gain from\nthe exercise. And we know that the eating will be counterproductive. So after exercise\nheavy and obese people should skip snacks and stay away from cold water and other\ncold drinks, and choose hot drinks such as herbal teas.\nEAT YOUR BIGGEST MEAL EARLY IN THE DAY\n. According to Ayurveda, the best policy regarding\nmeals, if you are overweight, is to skip breakfast entirely (maybe have some hot herbal\ntea), then take your biggest meal at noon. Supper should be light. Don\u2019t snack between\nthe two meals.\nIf you can\u2019t seem to skip breakfast, take your main meal then, early in the day. Have\na light lunch and a lighter supper; skip supper entirely if you can.\nDROP ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO\n. Quit drinking alcohol and smoking.

While eating your meals, listen to soft music and chew your food more,\nso that moderate eating gradually becomes habitual.\nLEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF\n. Most obese people do not love themselves. This is signi\u0279cant\nbecause there is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body;\nlove is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, he or\nshe may try to \u0279nd love through eating, and food will become a substitute for love.\nWhen a woman misses her husband or a man misses his wife, they frequently begin to\neat too much.\nT\nIME TO\n S\nEE THE\n D\nOCTOR\nIf you are very heavy and have not exercised for a long time, and especially\nif you are over 40, you \nmust\n see your doctor before you start an exercise\nprogram more strenuous than walking.\nObese people also hate how they look, and they hate looking in the mirror because\nthey don\u2019t like what they see. When people hate their body, they become anxious and\nworried; then suddenly they become hungry and need to eat. This is not real hunger; it is\nfalse, emotional hunger. (See \u201c\nEating Disorders\n\u201d and \u201c\nOvereating\n\u201d for further discussion\nof emotional eating.)\nTo help develop more love for yourself just as you are, try this technique. Go into\nyour bathroom and remove all your clothes, or wear some shorts. Then take a good look\nat the person you see in the full-length mirror. Look at that image, starting at the head,\nthe eyes, cheeks, lips, and neck; look at your chest, your belly, and so on.\nAs you look at the image in your mirror, at the same time look within. Ask yourself,\ndo you like those eyes of yours? Do you love your nose? Don\u2019t you have some a\u0283ection\ntoward your own lips, your own chest?\nIn this way, gradually, by looking outside, into the mirror, and at the same time\ninside at your own inner observer, two things will happen. First, you will begin to feel\nthat you are beyond your body, that you are something higher, nobler, greater, and\nmore beautiful, that you are pure existence. Second, this process will also bring greater\nacceptance, and you will start feeling more love for yourself. So look at yourself in the\nmirror, and love that person that you see.\nA second important factor in loving yourself \nis to stop judging, comparing, and\ncriticizing yourself. What you are is unique, and it is divine. Stopping judgment,\ncriticism, and comparison is the beginning of self-love.\nThese two exercises will really help.\nDRINK HOT WATER AND HONEY\n.

Don\u2019t try to lose a lot of weight all at once. That almost never brings long-term\nimprovement. Kapha individuals are noted for their ability to make steady, determined,\nconsistent progress. So be persistent, and over time you will be successful.\n \nOsteoporosis\n \nOsteoporosis is a thinning and increasing porosity of the bone due to increased vata.\nBones are normally porous, but because of increasing vata\u2014a normal occurrence as a\nperson grows older\u2014the porosity increases. Sometimes the individual loses so much\nbone that weak spots develop in the skeletal structure. Then the hips, forearms, or even\nthe spine can fracture quite easily. The bones may crack under the body\u2019s own weight,\nor a minor injury may be enough to create a fracture.\nOsteoporosis is more common in women than men. Women lose bone rapidly after\nmenopause. This is because the postmenopausal body produces little or no estrogen,\nwhich is necessary for maintaining bone metabolism utilizing calcium, magnesium, zinc,\nand other materials for building the bone. So it is during the postmenopausal years that\nwomen may have a tendency toward osteoporosis.\nMen also need estrogen to maintain strong bones, but testosterone and prostatic\nsecretions also play an important role. However, men may lose bone mass due to heavy\ndrinking, heavy smoking, chewing tobacco, and taking steroids.\nLack of exercise can also reduce bone mass. To some extent, people need some stress\nto the body, in the form of exercise. Research has shown that if a person is con\u0279ned to\nbed for several weeks, the bones become signi\u0279cantly weaker. Once the ill e\u0283ects of lack\nof exercise became clear, exercise programs were designed even for astronauts in space.\nExercise is a food for the bones.\nFor women, the combination of increased vata simply from growing older (see\nchapter 2\n, where we talk about the stages of life), plus the menopausal cessation of\nestrogen, may have a powerfully deleterious effect on bone mass.\nEXERCISE\n. Gentle, daily exercise for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, can help to treat\nosteoporosis. Walking is excellent and quite sufficient, but you may do swimming, gentle\njogging, or whatever suits your constitution and level of \u0279tness, and the condition of\nyour bones.\nSome people recommend weight-bearing exercise, even including weight lifting, for\nbuilding bone. While this is good in general, for a person with osteoporosis it can be\nquite dangerous; as mentioned above, even a slight injury may crack the fragile bones of\na person with osteoporosis. Therefore a good, \nsafe way to begin an exercise program is\nto do some underwater exercise.

It is important to get a plentiful supply of calcium from natural food sources,\nsuch as sesame seeds, soybeans, soy milk, cow\u2019s milk, cheese, carrots, and coconut.\nCalcium supplements, such as from oyster shells, may also be helpful. Your daily dose\nshould include about 1,200 mg. calcium, along with 600 mg. magnesium and 60 mg. zinc\nfor maximum absorption and effectiveness.\nAlmond milk also contains a signi\u0279cant amount of calcium. Soak ten almonds\novernight in water. In the morning, peel them and blend in the blender with a cup of\nwarm milk. (You can use goat\u2019s milk or soy milk if you prefer them to cow\u2019s milk.)

In such individuals, overeating may occasionally\noccur. But most overeating takes place because of emotional factors, and that is what we\nwill be considering here.\nFood nourishes the body; love nourishes the soul. When you are with a loving friend\nor close family members, you can become so happy that you forget to eat. You feel no\nneed for food at that time because you receive a higher food\u2014love.\nBut when a person doesn\u2019t receive that love or feel that happiness, he or she becomes\nlonely or has a feeling of rejection or of not being loved. Food may become the\nsubstitute for love. So eating, in order to suppress feelings of loneliness, grief, sadness,\nor depression, is the emotional, psychological cause of overeating. Statistically,\novereating happens more in women than in men.\nFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, due to emotional factors and stress, \nprana\n vata\nstimulates \njatharagni\n, the gastric \u0279re, and this stimulation activates the stomach. The\nstimulation is translated or experienced as hunger, and that is the reason people may\neat more food.\nThere are many ways to deal with the problem of overeating. With a little care, it\ncan be overcome.\nEXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS\n. First, you have to let go of your feelings of loneliness and not being\nloved. Write about your feelings. Express them. That way, the energy that is blocked in\nthe solar plexus starts releasing, and emotional hunger will begin to subside.\nMEDITATE AND BREATHE\n. Whenever you feel emotionally hungry, sit quietly and pay\nattention to your breath. Or do 10 to 15 minutes of \nSo-Hum\n meditation (see \nchapter 7\n).\nShitali pranayama\n (making a tube of the tongue and inhaling through that tube into\nthe belly) will also be quite helpful. (See \nchapter 6\n.)\n\u2022 Or take 12 deep breaths, then drink a cup of warm water. This will help dissolve the\nemotional hunger, and overeating can be avoided.\nYOGA\n. Yoga exercises such as the Moon Salutation, Camel pose, Cobra pose, and Spinal\nTwist will help you control overeating due to emotional factors (see \nappendix 4\n).\nWALK OFF THE CRAVINGS\n. Whenever you have emotional cravings for food, take a brisk walk\nfor 20 minutes in the fresh air. That will help reduce the cravings.\nEAT LIGHTLY\n. If you feel you must eat, then eat some light food. Try some light crackers,\nor some cereal or grains such as millet or rye. Or drink some fruit juice. Follow a low-fat\ndiet. (See the guidelines for the kapha diet in \nchapter 8\n.) That way you won\u2019t have to\ndeny yourself when you feel like eating, but the light food won\u2019t put on weight or fat.\nTRY BANANAS\n.

When you are hungry, here is one way to \u0279nd out whether it is an\nemotional craving or a real biological need. Drink some licorice tea, chamomile tea, or\nmint tea. If it was emotional hunger, the warm soothing tea will take care of it, and you\nwill feel better. If you are really hungry and need some food, the tea won\u2019t diminish\nyour appetite.\nFOR HYPERTHYROIDISM\n. If your overeating is due to hyperthyroidism, which is a metabolic\ndisorder, Ayurveda suggests using \nkaishore guggulu\n. This herbal compound helps to\nregulate metabolism and pacifies overactive thyroid.\nDRINK \nBRAHMI\n MILK\n. When you feel hungry, drinking 1 cup of warm milk boiled with \u00bd\nteaspoon of \nbrahmi\n will help you control overeating.\nIF YOU HAVE ALREADY EATEN TOO MUCH\n. Roast 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel\nseeds on a heavy iron pan, without any oil. (Stir constantly to avoid burning.) Add a\npinch of salt, let the mixture cool, and eat it. It will help with indigestion.\nAnother aid to indigestion from overeating is to drink a cupful of water into which\nyou have added the juice of half a lemon; just before drinking, add a pinch of baking\nsoda, stir, and drink quickly.\n \nOverweight\n \nSee \u201c\nObesity\n\u201d\n \nPMS\n \nSee also \u201c\nMenstrual Difficulties\n\u201d\nTYPES OF PMS\nPremenstrual syndrome or PMS is classi\u0279ed in Ayurveda in three types: vata, pitta,\nand kapha.\n\u2022 Vata type is characterized by low backache, lower abdominal pain, distention,\nanxiety, fear, insomnia, and mood swings.\n\u2022 Pitta-type PMS symptoms include tenderness in the breasts, urethritis, hives, hot\nflashes, irritability, and sometimes a burning sensation when passing urine.\n\u2022 Kapha-type PMS involves water retention (breasts become enlarged and tender)\nand drowsiness, so that the woman loves to drink coffee!\nPMS can be cared for successfully using the following Ayurvedic remedies and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0565e81-ca1c-4a3a-b6b7-b1d728e587b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0565e81-ca1c-4a3a-b6b7-b1d728e587b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bab3a19b-bd83-443e-a9a6-8692b27a1200", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "7ef01a6b2f0be79cb170668605fa47feb9225d80c6ce62318a09ca0e49caaf2e"}}, "hash": "7ef01a6b2f0be79cb170668605fa47feb9225d80c6ce62318a09ca0e49caaf2e", "text": "preventive measures.\nIMPORTANT\n: In all cases, start the preventive program one week before the\nanticipated start of your period.\nFOR VATA-TYPE PMS\n\u2022 Drink \ndashamoola\n tea (\u00bd teaspoon \ndashamoola\n steeped in a cup of hot water for 10\nminutes); you can add a little honey for taste.

In men who have this problem, cholesterol deposition takes place in the\nblood vessels of the penis and the entire reproductive system. These blood vessels\nbecome thick and narrow (ischemia), so that the blood supply to the muscles of the penis\nand prostate is insu\u027dcient, causing lack of sphincter control and leading to premature\nejaculation.\nPremature ejaculation can be brought under control. Here are some e\u0283ective ways to\ndeal with it.\nMASSAGE THE PENIS\n. Do a gentle massage of the penis. To 1 ounce of sesame oil, add 5 to\n10 drops of mustard oil. The diluted mustard oil has a heating e\u0283ect, which will dilate\nthe blood vessels and improve the circulation of blood to the penis.\nIMPORTANT\n: Do this massage about 1 hour before intercourse, and be sure to\nwash the penis thoroughly beforehand, or your partner\u2019s delicate skin may feel\nburned by the hot mustard oil. You can also use castor oil, which will improve\nthe tone of the sphincter muscles.\n\u2022 Certain medicated ghees, such as \nbrahmi\n ghee, \nshatavari\n ghee, or \nashwagandha\n ghee,\ncan also be used for massaging the pubic bone and the glans penis before making love.\nPRACTICE\n. Practice stimulating the organ up to the point of ejaculation, but don\u2019t\nejaculate. Then sit up straight (in a Lotus posture, if you can), and raise the energy by\ndoing Ashwini Mudra, pulling or sucking the anus inward in a series of tense-release\nmovements. Do about 10 repetitions of the Ashwini Mudra. This way you train your\norgan to be ready but not to ejaculate. To succeed at this, you have to practice with\ngreat care.\nDo this exercise about 1 to 2 hours before making love.\nIMPORTANT\n: This is not masturbation, nor an endorsement of masturbation.\n\u2022 You can also learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.\n\u2022 Locate the \nmarma\n point (an energy center like an acupressure point) at the center\nof the glans penis, on the underside. Gently press that point, and at the same time suck\nthe anus inward and hold for \u0279ve seconds. Release. Do this 10 times. This will improve\nthe blood supply to the penis and will help to maintain the erection. Do this about 1\nhour before sex.\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Helpful yoga \nasanas\n include the Bow, Fish, and Camel poses, Elevated\nLotus, and Vajrasana.\nDIET SUGGESTIONS\n. As mentioned, premature ejaculation is a vata disorder, so a man with\nthis problem should adhere to a vata-soothing diet (see guidelines in \nchapter 8\n). If you\nhave high cholesterol, follow a low-cholesterol diet. And if you have diabetes, keep your\nsugar intake low.

Again, cow\u2019s milk is\nacceptable if you can\u2019t locate fresh goat\u2019s milk.\nALMOND MILK\n. Soak 10 almonds overnight in water. In the morning peel o\u0283 the skin, put\nthe almonds in a blender, and add 1 cup hot cow\u2019s milk and a pinch each of ginger,\ncardamom, and sa\u0283ron. (Sa\u0283ron is a mild aphrodisiac.) Drink almond milk every\nmorning. You can also make a second cupful in the evening.\nHEAL THE PROSTATE\n. Premature ejaculation often accompanies prostate problems such as\nprostatitis, or it may be a warning of developing problems. To help with this, massage\nthe area of the prostate gland with castor oil. Apply a small amount of the oil (sesame\noil is also bene\u0279cial) to the perineum, the area in between the anus and testicles. First\nrub in a circular motion, then \u0279nish with strokes from the anus toward the base of the\npenis. Don\u2019t press hard; use light strokes.\n \nProstate Problems\n \nIn middle-aged men, it is uncommonly common for the prostate gland to become\nenlarged, resulting in a number of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, the man may\nwake up several times during the night to pass urine. He may have di\u027dculty urinating,\nso that it may take some moments for the \u027bow to start, or the \u027bow may be slow, or it\nmay \u201cdribble\u201d at the end. He may \u0279nd that the need to urinate occurs rather suddenly,\nor that he feels a frequent need to go. This happens when the bladder does not empty\ncompletely during urination; even though there may not be much urine left in the\nbladder, the residual fluid creates the sensation of needing to go.\nAnother problem that sometimes develops is prostatitis (in\u027bammation of the\nprostate), which has many of the same symptoms described above but also is\ncharacterized by a burning sensation while passing urine.\nHERBAL REMEDIES\nA number of herbal remedies are effective in treating prostate problems.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2251, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "167bca3a-bcfc-45d0-9606-2e6c38f7c7d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "167bca3a-bcfc-45d0-9606-2e6c38f7c7d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "269", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77347b59-d481-4b49-ad27-d9af2919cc12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "269", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "d3a0b35ee7acb4b2a4d40e17027deda411c1e84a31365e222e7891901f8d07bf"}}, "hash": "d3a0b35ee7acb4b2a4d40e17027deda411c1e84a31365e222e7891901f8d07bf", "text": "\u2022 Make this formula of Ayurvedic herbs:\npunarnava 2 parts\nshilajit \u215b part\ngokshura 2 parts\nTake \u00bc teaspoon twice a day, after meals, with a little warm water.\nContinue to take it until your symptoms resolve.\n\u2022 You can also use ginseng, hibiscus, or horsetail tea, available in packages or as bulk\nherbs in most natural food stores.

These include hemorrhoids;\nin\u027bammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal \u0279ssures or polyps; passing\ndry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to\nconstipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive\nheart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor\nexerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also\ncommon among people who eat re\u0279ned foods containing little \u0279ber. Eating hot spicy\nfood may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.\nWhatever the cause, the following recommendations will be helpful.\nWASH WITH COOL WATER\n. After each bowel movement, wash the anal ori\u0279ce with cool water.\nThis will help stop the bleeding, and if there is irritation, itching, and cracking, it will\nhelp to minimize it.\nAPPLY GHEE OR CASTOR OIL\n.

If the bleeding is profuse, go sooner. The\nbleeding could be a symptom of a serious illness.\nAVOID HOT SPICY FOOD\n. Follow the pitta-pacifying diet (see \nchapter 8\n). Also avoid fermented\nfood, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.\nKEEP THE STOOLS SOFT\n. This will help to minimize irritation and bleeding. Here are three\nways to keep stools soft:\n\u2022 Drink a cup of warm milk with 1 teaspoon plain ghee at bedtime.

This\nbulk laxative will keep the stools soft and avoid pressure on the rectal blood vessels.\nUSE VITAMIN K\n. If the bleeding is serious (that is, profuse or repeated), take vitamin K\nsupplements according to the dosage recommended on the package. Also, you can buy\nvitamin K cream at most health food stores. Apply this cream to the anal ori\u0279ce to stop\nthe bleeding.\nPACIFY PITTA\n.

Avoid hot spicy foods, fermented foods, and yeast-containing bread.\nStay away from alcohol entirely.\n \nSinus Problems\n \nThe sinuses are air-\u0279lled cavities located on either side of the nose. There are ten\nsinus cavities, \u0279ve on each side, all connected to the nose. They are covered with a\nsuper\u0279ne mucous membrane. The sinuses drain constantly into the nose; their chief\nfunction is to keep the nasal cavity moist. They also serve to amplify the voice when we\nspeak.\nDue to allergies, colds, or bacterial infections, the sinuses in both adults and children\nsometimes get clogged or infected. This is a condition of excess kapha that can be\naggravated by many factors, including cold drinks, dairy products, and smoking.\nSinus problems can create complications of various kinds, from sinus headaches,\nsnoring, and di\u027dculty breathing to bad breath, ear infections, and sleep apnea. In\nserious cases, sinus infections can lead to brain infection, meningitis, or osteomyelitis.\nHERBAL DECONGESTANT\n. When the sinuses become clogged and congested, it is important to\ndrain them.

(You can use\npowdered ginger as a backup if you don\u2019t have fresh.)\nHere is a more powerful remedy that you can use for severe sinus congestion and\npain. You may not enjoy doing this, but it works. Use a garlic press to squeeze out some\nfresh garlic juice. With an eye dropper, pick up some juice and insert just a few drops\ninto each nostril. Keep your head tilted back for about \u0279ve minutes to let the juice work,\nthen sit up and let it drain out onto a tissue. You will be surprised at how clear your\nsinuses feel.

Daily oil massage over your whole body is very e\u0283ective for keeping your\nskin healthy and beautiful. If you are vata or have a vata imbalance, use sesame oil. If\nyou are pitta or have a pitta imbalance, use sun\u027bower oil. If you are kapha or have a\nkapha imbalance, use corn oil or canola oil. Gentle oil massage maintains the beauty\nand texture of the skin.\nTAKE TURMERIC\n. To have beautiful skin, take a capsule of turmeric daily. Ayurvedic\ntradition states that if a pregnant woman takes turmeric regularly, her child will have\ngorgeous skin!\nGET ENOUGH IRON IN YOUR DIET\n. If your skin looks pale, it may be a sign of anemia. Drink\nsome carrot juice, and eat cooked beets. This will give you natural iron and should\nimprove skin color. (See further suggestions under \u201c\nAnemia\n.\u201d)\nSOAK UP SOME SUN\n. Apply the appropriate doshic oil to your skin (sesame for vata\nconstitutions, coconut or sun\u027bower for pitta, corn for kapha), and lie in the sun for a\nlittle while\u201410 to 15 minutes, or at the most half an hour. This will improve the\ncirculation and strengthen skin tone.\nNOTE\n: Sunbathing should be done either before noon or in the late afternoon\n(after three o\u2019clock), when the rays are not as direct. Also, the danger of sunburn\nis greater at high altitudes, so take care to limit your exposure when you\u2019re in\nthe mountains.\nUSE HERBALIZED OILS\n.

As a general rule, it is bene\u0279cial to use soap on your skin only once\nor twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people\nsweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have\nto take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much\nsweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.\nOf course, it depends on a person\u2019s job. Someone who does hard physical work and\nsweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it\u2019s important\nnot to wash o\u0283 the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we\napply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.\nPitta constitutional types may need soap a little more often, perhaps three times a\nweek, both because they tend to perspire more and because pitta skin tends to be more\noily.\nMATCH WATER TEMPERATURE TO YOUR CONSTITUTION\n. Generally, washing in cool water is\nrecommended for pitta, warm water for kapha, and hot water for vata. Vata individuals\noften have poor circulation, and hot water will improve circulation and help to keep\nskin healthy and beautiful.\nGENTLE TOWEL MASSAGE\n. After bathing, gently rub your towel over the skin of your \nface and\nbody. This improves cutaneous circulation, removes dead skin, and helps your skin look\nyoung.\nHome Face-lift\nYou can do your own home facial massage and face-lift by applying gentle\npressure from the chin to the forehead.\nFace-lift Massage\nPut your two index \u0279ngers together, and your two thumbs.

Sleep apnea is a brief interruption in\nbreathing during deep sleep\u2014sometimes numerous interruptions in a single night\u2014that\nis quite common in young children but also occurs in some adults. It may also happen at\nhigh altitudes. Sleep apnea is often accompanied by loud snoring and an abnormal\nbreathing pattern.\nApnea in older children and adults is less life-threatening. But because the person\u2019s\nsleep is brie\u027by interrupted each time the breathing stops, sometimes dozens of times in a\nnight, it can be physically exhausting. It strains the cardiovascular system and\nrespiratory system and may create excess carbon dioxide in the blood. It may lead to\ndrowsiness and irritability during the wakeful state and an inability to concentrate, due\nto insufficient sleep.\nIn Ayurvedic terms, sleep apnea occurs because \ntarpaka\n kapha is blocking \nprana\n vata.\nSo treatment centers on controlling excess kapha.\nTO CONTROL KAPHA\n. The \u0279rst remedy is \npippali\n.

Also, at times of pressure or emotional disturbance, smokers habitually\nreach for a cigarette. So two parallel strategies are needed: detoxifying the nicotine\ntoxicity and dealing with the stress.\nHERBAL CIGARETTE\n. To gradually wean yourself from smoking, Ayurveda suggests that you\nprepare the following herbal mixture. It will help both with reducing your stress level\nand with detoxifying your body.

Or just cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew that.\n\u2022 Ginger tea will also increase the gastric \u0279re and reduce the stomachache. Boil a\nlittle fresh ginger (grated, chopped, or sliced), or use powdered ginger to make a tea,\nand drink it 2 or 3 times a day.\n\u2022 \nDraksha\n (Ayurvedic herbal wine) before meals will help to kindle the digestive \u0279re.\nUse 2 to 4 tablespoons mixed with an equal amount of water. Or take a few sips of port\nor another sweet wine.\n\u2022 Another simple way to enliven your gastric \u0279re is to use the common spice bay leaf.\nSteep \u00bd teaspoon of crushed or ground bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10\nminutes to make a tea. Add a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.\nADDITIONAL REMEDIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nEAT LIGHTLY\n. If your stomach hurts, avoid eating any heavy meals, beans, meat, and\nheavier grains like wheat. It is better to be on a diet of kitchari, a combination of rice\nand dal that is easy to digest.

When you have an upset stomach, Ayurveda recommends that\nyou just rest, read, and relax as much as you can until the condition clears. Exercise,\nincluding \nyoga asanas\n, is not recommended.\n \nStress\n \nStress is a psychosomatic disorder that has many causes in our day-to-day life. We\nmay \nget stressed when tra\u027dc is jammed, when we have to stand in a long line, or when\nwe deal with a di\u027dcult work situation. An all-too-common cause of stress is the feeling\nthat we have too much to do and too little time to do it. Unemployment is another\npotential source, as are pollution and crime. Even watching crime stories day after day\non television builds up stress. An unhappy relationship, a dominating spouse, faulty\nplumbing, school exams, burn-out at work\u2014the list of causes is virtually endless.\nStress, in turn, may trigger allergies, asthma, herpes, high cholesterol, and\nhypertension. It may even lead to a heart condition. It can induce an imbalance of vata,\npitta, or kapha, depending on the individual\u2019s \nprakruti\n (constitution).\nGenerally, vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions,\nsuch as anxiety or fearfulness, even phobias or anxiety neurosis. Pitta individuals\nincrease in pitta during stressful situations and typically react to stress in the form of\nanger. They may also su\u0283er from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other\npitta disorders. Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function,\nslow metabolism, and even increased blood sugar, leading to a prediabetic condition.\nThey tend to eat and eat and eat and become chubby.\nTAKE A RELAXATION BREAK\n. To prevent the buildup of stress, the \u0279rst line of defense is to stay\ncalm and cool during potentially stressful circumstances. Take long, deep breaths, and\nbreathe out your stress. Relax. Have a massage, or give yourself an oil massage by\nrubbing a few ounces of warm oil on your body, from head to toe. Vata individuals\nshould use sessame oil, pitta individuals sun\u027bower oil, and kapha individuals corn oil.\nAfter your massage, take a hot shower or a hot tub bath. Mental techniques such as\npositive imagery, prayer, singing and chanting, and meditation, as well as regular yoga\nexercises, are all effective to minimize and remedy stress.\nANALYZE YOUR STRESS\n. Separate the things in your life that you \u0279nd stressful into two\ncategories: things you can do something about, and things you can\u2019t. If you can do\nsomething about it, then do it! If there\u2019s nothing you can do, then surrender to it. Accept\nit.

A ginger-baking soda bath is quite soothing. Add \u2153 cup ginger and \u2153\ncup baking soda to a hot bath for greater relaxation and healing.\nOILS FOR RELAXATION\n. Rub a little \nbrahmi\n oil on the soles of your feet and on your scalp at\nbedtime.\n\u2022 Put one drop of pure castor oil (with no preservatives) into each of your eyes, and\nrub a little on the soles of your feet for a calming, soothing effect.\nUSE MEDICATED NOSE DROPS\n. Do \nnasya\n with \nbrahmi\n ghee or plain ghee. Put 5 drops of the ghee\ninto each nostril. (Refer to the \nnasya\n instructions in \nappendix 3\n.)\nSTRESS-REDUCING TEA\n. A tea made from equal proportions of the herbs chamomile, comfrey,\nand angelica will be relaxing. So will \nbrahmi\n tea, which you can make by adding a cup\nof boiling water to \u00bd teaspoon \nbrahmi\n. Or try a tea made from equal amounts of these\nherbs:\nbrahmi\nbhringaraj\njatamamsi\nshanka pushpi\nSteep \u00bd teaspoon in 1 cup of hot water for 10 minutes. You can drink this tea\n2 or 3 times a day for stress management.\nYOGA STRETCHING\n. Certain speci\u0279c \nasanas\n are e\u0283ectively used for management of stress,\nespecially the Shoulder Stand, Plow pose, Spinal Twist, and Locust pose. The Lion pose\nis also effective for relieving stress. (\nAsana\n illustrations appear in \nappendix 4\n.)\nMEDITATION\n. Sit in the Lotus pose or the Easy pose (legs comfortably crossed) facing\neast, and meditate. Just observe the inflow and outflow of your breath, or do the \nSo-Hum\nmeditation (described in \nchapter 7\n).\nBREATHE AWAY STRESS\n. \nUjjayi pranayama\n is deeply calming and helpful for relieving stress.\nYou can do it sitting up, or try lying on your back in Savasana (the \u201ccorpse\u201d or rest\npose) and doing this breathing exercise.

Laughter is another good way to relieve stress. Try it, even if it\nis forced at \u0279rst. Just start laughing! Soon real laughter will come and with it the release\nof tension and stress.\nSTART YOUR WEEK WITH MEDITATION\n. Many people experience extra stress on Monday. They\nhave to travel a long distance to work and start another week at a job they don\u2019t enjoy.\nIt\u2019s a fact that heart attacks are more common on Mondays. To help you reduce stress at\nthis crucial time, keep in mind that Monday is the day of the moon, and the moon\nrepresents the mind. So begin Monday morning\u2014and your week\u2014with 15 to 20 minutes\nof meditation before going to work. Regular daily meditation, morning and \nevening, is\none of the best things you can do to keep your stress level low.\n \nSunburn\n \nSunburn is an acute in\u027bammatory condition of the skin cells due to overexposure to\nultraviolet radiation from the sun (or a solar lamp). The in\u027bammation may be mild or\nserious, depending on the degree of exposure.\nSomething more may also be involved, however. Many people use large amounts of\nchemical products on their skin, as well as internally\u2014chemical deodorants, chemical\nsoaps, chemical perfumes, cough medicines, and numerous other medications. These\nsubstances all weaken the skin. When a person who uses a large number of these\nproducts lies in the sun, he or she is more prone to burn.\nAlso, according to Ayurveda, people of pitta constitution, who are generally more\nfair-skinned, are more susceptible to sunburn.\nWhen sunburn is severe, the person may have many symptoms, including dizziness,\nnausea, blisters, undue sensitivity to light, and peeling of the skin. Repeated sunburn\nmay create premature aging and wrinkling of the skin, and the person looks old, like a\nroasted potato!\nAyurveda has numerous recommendations both to prevent sunburn and to treat it\neffectively if it happens.\nTOPICAL REMEDIES TO SOOTHE SUNBURN\n\u2022 Apply aloe vera cream to the site of the burn. You can also use some pure aloe vera\ngel (with no preservatives added), or if you have access to an aloe plant, lightly rub a\npiece of the plant on the sunburned area.\n\u2022 Coconut oil is also effective for soothing sunburned skin.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2367, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33725106-8a71-4492-8ffa-ee45574eb23f": {"__data__": {"id_": "33725106-8a71-4492-8ffa-ee45574eb23f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d90eec07-a878-4f15-adc3-15807d369b97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "a47d93a40b8432ad75a6dd0df927a4d7bbb50bd8b6812b782f2a44406f5c3667"}}, "hash": "a47d93a40b8432ad75a6dd0df927a4d7bbb50bd8b6812b782f2a44406f5c3667", "text": "\u2022 Take a gauze pad, dip it into cool milk (either cow\u2019s milk or goat\u2019s milk), and apply\nit directly to the sunburn.

The swelling may be due to anemia. Folic acid anemia is common\nduring pregnancy, and iron de\u0279ciency anemia not uncommon. You can have tests to\ndetermine whether you have these de\u0279ciencies. If you do, providing the missing\ningredients will help reduce or eliminate the swelling. See \u201c\nAnemia\n\u201d for suggestions.\nPROTEIN DEFICIENCY\n. Lack of protein may also be the culprit. If you determine that this is\nthe case, eat more protein foods, such as soy products.\nADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO RELIEVE EDEMA\nEXERCISE\n. Walking every day for 20 to 30 minutes will improve circulation and help\nreduce swelling.\nAVOID SALT\n. Salt makes the body retain water and promotes swelling.\nRAISE YOUR FEET\n. When lying down, put a pillow under your feet. This will drain the\nwater and help to gradually decrease the swelling.\n \nTeeth and Gums\u2014Ayurvedic Care\n \nAccording to Ayurveda, teeth are a by-product of bone. Cavities in the teeth, and\nreceding gums, are signs of aggravation of vata in the skeletal system.\nFOR MINERAL DEFICIENCY\n. Problems with teeth are often related to a de\u0279ciency of calcium,\nmagnesium, and zinc. To prevent future problems or to alleviate a deficiency:\n\u2022 Chew a handful of calcium-rich white sesame seeds every morning. (Then brush\nyour teeth without putting any toothpaste on the brush, so the residue of the sesame\nseeds can rub against your teeth, polishing and cleaning them.)\n\u2022 You can also use a mineral supplement containing a daily dose of approximately\nthese amounts: calcium (1,200 mg.), magnesium (600 mg.), and zinc (60 mg.) per tablet.\nMASSAGE YOUR GUMS\n. You can make your teeth healthier and more beautiful by massaging\nyour gums daily with sesame oil. Take a mouthful of warm sesame oil and swish it from\nside to side for 2 to 3 minutes. Don\u2019t swallow it. Spit out the oil, then gently massage\nyour gums with your index \u0279nger. This is an excellent preventive measure \nfor receding\ngums, tooth infection, and cavities.\nHERBAL TOOTH CLEANSER\n. Ayurvedic dentistry recommends the use of bitter and astringent\nherbs for cleaning the teeth. The main herbs used are \nneem\n, which is bitter, and \nlohdra,\nkushta\n, and \nbilva\n, which are all astringent. You can make an excellent cleanser for\nbrushing your teeth by mixing the powdered form of \nneem\n and an equal amount of any\nof the astringent herbs and use the mixture to brush your teeth as usual.

These are highly bene\u0279cial for maintaining the good health of the\nteeth.\nUSE TEA TREE OIL FOR RECEDING GUMS AND SENSITIVE TEETH\n. Receding gums, and sensitivity of teeth to\ncold and hot temperatures, indicate a bacterial infection in the roots of the teeth.\n\u2022 To treat the infection, wet a clean toothbrush, and put a few drops of tea tree oil\ndirectly onto the brush. Brush your teeth. Then use a cotton swab to apply some tea tree\noil to the exposed part of the gums. This treatment will help arrest further infection of\nthe teeth and will take care of pain and sensitivity to hot and cold.\n\u2022 You can also apply some tea tree oil to your dental \u027boss. This will help you reach\nsome possible deep pockets of infection that the brush doesn\u2019t reach. (Commercial \u027boss\ntreated with tea tree oil is also available.)\nCHEW WELL\n. Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of chewing food well. This not only\nhelps the digestive process, but also stimulates the gums.\nTRY FIGS\n. For strengthening teeth and gums, try eating 4 \u0279gs and chewing them well,\nonce a day.\nTAP YOUR TEETH\n. \nGently\n tap your teeth together 5 or 6 times, almost clenching them\u2014but\ngently, so that you don\u2019t break the crowns! This is said to stimulate the energy meridians\nrelated to the teeth.\n \nTendinitis\n \nIn strenuous sports and athletic activities such as running or jumping, a person can\npull a muscle and cause in\u027bammation of the tendon, leading to tendinitis or bursitis.\nThis condition can also result from a nonstrenuous activity repeated often enough to\nbecome stressful. An example is carpal tunnel syndrome, the result of working for hours\na day at a repetitive task such as typing at a computer keyboard.\nFOR MILD CONDITIONS\nCOLD COMPRESS\n. At the site of tendinitis, apply a cold compress such as an ice pack or a\nbag of frozen vegetables. That will minimize the inflammation.\nAPPLY A COOL PASTE\n.

This may\nlead to in\u027bammation, swelling, pain, and \npossible infection. Generally, the nails of vata\nand kapha individuals grow stronger, so they are more prone to toenail infection. Shoes\nthat are too tight can create pressure on the nails, also potentially leading to toenail\ninfection.\nThe long-term solution is simply to cut the nail straight across, or with a slightly half-\nmoon shape (a concave curve). That allows the nail to grow straight forward instead of\ninto the skin at the sides.\nIf the nails have already begun to grow under the skin, soak your foot in warm water\nto soften the nails. When the nails are soft, clean them and apply some tea tree oil\nmixed half and half with \nneem\n oil under the nail. Then cut the nail straight across.\nTo prevent recurrences, wear soft shoes that are not tight, and cut the nails straight\nacross or in a shallow half-moon shape.\n \nToothache\n \nSee also \u201c\nTeeth and Gums\u2014Ayurvedic Care\n\u201d, \u201c\nGum Disease\n\u201d\nToothache may be caused by receding gums, cavities, sensitivity due to hyperacidity,\nand/or infection.\nIf high acidity is the problem, the person will tend to get heartburn and acid\nindigestion in addition to toothache. You can control the acidity by following a pitta-\nsoothing diet, particularly avoiding spicy foods, pickles, citrus fruits, and fermented\nfoods (see \nchapter 8\n).\nWhen the teeth have cavities or the gums are receding, the roots of the teeth may\nbecome exposed. These nerve-filled areas become sensitive to cold or heat. (Sensitivity to\ncold is a sign of receding gums, while sensitivity to heat indicates infection.)\nFor any toothache, use a cotton swab to apply a little tea tree oil or clove oil at the\nsite of the pain. Or a small piece of natural, edible camphor (not the synthetic kind,\nwhich is poisonous) can be placed next to the painful tooth.

Pitta is hot, sharp, and\npenetrating, and when aggravated, it can erode the surface of internal organs or soft\ntissues. The mucous membrane lining the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon can\ndevelop ulceration because of excess pitta.\nIndividuals with a pitta constitution or pitta disorder, or whose blood type is O and\nRh-positive, are more prone to developing ulcers. A person with ulcers may experience\npain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, midback ache, and shoulder pain.\nTHE MAIN PRINCIPLE FOR TREATMENT: PACIFY PITTA\n. Ulcers can be e\u0283ectively treated by treating the\nhigh pitta. If you have ulcers, strictly follow the pitta-pacifying diet: avoid hot spicy\nfood, fermented or sour \nfood, sour fruit, and citrus fruit. (See \nchapter 8\n for complete\nguidelines.) Stay away from alcohol, tobacco, and co\u0283ee. And do not take aspirins or\nsteroids, which can accelerate erosion of the gastric mucosal membrane.\nTWO HERBAL FORMULAS\n. An effective herbal treatment for ulcers is the following formula:\nshatavari 5 parts\nyashti madhu 3 parts\nshanka bhasma \u215b part\nkama dudha \u215b part\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of this mixture twice a day, after lunch and dinner, with a\nlittle warm water.\n\u2022 Taking 1 teaspoon of \nsat isabgol\n (psyllium husks) at bedtime with a cup of warm\nmilk will also be beneficial.\nREDUCE STRESS\n. Stress is often the cause of or a complicating factor in ulcers. To help\ndissolve stress, make yourself some Tranquillity Tea from these herbs:\njatamamsi\nbrahmi\nshanka pushpi\nCombine the herbs in equal proportions, and use about \u00bd teaspoon of the\nmixture steeped in 1 cup of boiling water to make a tea. Drink it about an hour\nbefore going to bed.\nYOGA POSTURES\n. Yoga \nasanas\n can help you relax and relieve stress, which is bene\u0279cial for\nulcers. The following positions are particularly recommended for helping with ulcers:\nLeg Lift, Camel, Cobra, Bow, Bridge, and Spinal Twist.

Breathing exercises are\ndescribed in \nchapter 6\n.\nEAT EARLY IN THE EVENING, AND EAT SMALL MEALS\n. Persons with ulcers should not eat late at night.\nThey also do best if they eat small, frequent meals. Don\u2019t keep the stomach empty for\nlong. At least have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so the acid secreted in the stomach can\nbe utilized for digestion.\nAN EFFECTIVE HERBAL ACID BLOCKER\n. Today many people use acid-blocking medications for\nulcers. The best acid blocker in Ayurveda is a combination of the herbs\nbrahmi\njatamamsi\nyashti madhu\nin equal proportions. A tea made from \u00bd teaspoon of these herbs per cup of\nwater, taken after lunch and dinner, can help to inhibit acid secretions and\nprevent ulceration.\n \nUrinary Incontinence\n \nUrinary incontinence is primarily a vata disorder, caused by weakness of the muscles\nof \nthe bladder, especially the bladder sphincter. If that becomes weak and uncontrolled,\na person may lose voluntary control of urination to a greater or lesser extent.\nAnother cause of incontinence, especially in the West, seems to be the frequent use of\nrest rooms. When some people see a rest room, they just use it, whether the need is\nurgent or not. They apparently think (perhaps subconsciously), \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t have\nanother chance for a while.\u201d But the bladder muscles become weak and lose the capacity\nto retain a large amount of urine and pass it out only when really necessary.\nUrinary incontinence is more common among women than men, because their\nurethra is quite short. When women cough, sneeze, or strain, or even when laughing,\ntheir bladder may leak a little urine.\nThis disorder can be controlled by certain herbs, a periodic oil enema, and certain\nyoga exercises. Let\u2019s begin with the latter.\nYOGA\nASHWINI MUDRA\n. This exercise involves using the perineal muscles to suck the anus\ninward, tightening the gluteal muscles.

Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the\nexternal environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and\nspiritual practices\u2014all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical\nAyurvedic texts.\nFrom our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the\npurpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat?\nHow much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the \u0279ve-thousand-year-old\nliving tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.\nAs a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it\ncertainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health\nand healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda\u2014and of this book\u2014you have to put its\nprinciples into action. Just to run to the remedies section (\nPart III\n) when you have a\nhealth problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete\nscience of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.\nI would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is\ntotally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as\nunderstanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that\nfrom what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as\nwaking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may\ndecide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that\nmay be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen\novernight.\nOn the other hand, I would also not be \ntelling the truth if I didn\u2019t say that every\nsmall step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive\neffect on your body, mind, and consciousness.\nTo incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people\n\u0279nd it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type.\nThen gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily\nroutine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of\nthe suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.\nThe underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal\nhimself or herself.

We can do this by understanding\nour body and its needs, and by attending to those needs as they change in response to\nthe ever-changing outer environment and our inner world of feelings.

Within those major categories of symptoms,\nI describe literally hundreds of smaller signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms\nare nothing but the body\u2019s language. By presenting us with a headache, diarrhea, fever,\ntoothache, joint pain, insomnia, emotional anxiety, fear, or insecurity, the body is\ntalking to us, letting us know that something is wrong, something is out of balance and\nneeds our attention. It is the language of \ntridosha\n, of vata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha.\nAyurveda says that whatever symptom we experience is an expression of doshic\nimbalance. To restore good health, we have to reestablish balance by juggling the three\ndoshas, favoring this one or pacifying that, in order to attain harmony between \nvikruti\n,\nthe present doshic state, and \nprakruti\n, the original state of our constitution.\nAyurveda teaches us how to read this language of signs and symptoms. When, for\nexample, there are signs of excess heat in the body\u2014skin rash, heartburn, a \u027baring\ntemper\u2014we know that pitta dosha is in excess and needs to be paci\u0279ed. Similarly, out-\nof-balance vata may speak to us in terms of insomnia, constipation, or anxiety, while\nkapha imbalance may communicate its presence as lethargy, overeating, or congestion\nin the lungs, sinuses, and chest.\nWe should never disregard this language of \ntridosha\n. It is the foundation of health and\nhappiness, as well as of ill health.\nIn this book I have tried to share with you how to take care of those symptoms\u2014not\nsymptomatically but radically, fundamentally, basically. I have tried to show you how to\nuse the symptoms as a catalyst to reestablish balance within the \ntridosha\n, as well as\nbetween body, mind, and consciousness.\nBy any method, creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, and within\nvata\u2013pitta\u2013kapha, is called healing.

That is because all forms of matter, organic and\ninorganic, are simply the outer manifestations of this most subtle creative energy.\nMatter is the trapped light of consciousness. The vital force of life \u027bows from the\nuniversal source, the essence of all matter, and manifests in the myriad forms and\nphenomena of nature.\nThe classic texts of Ayurveda make it clear that all substances in nature contain this\ncosmic creative intelligence, and thus have a healing value when used in the proper\nmanner. That is why, in its quest to create and maintain perfect health, Ayurvedic\nmedicine makes use of almost everything in nature and in daily life, including food,\nbreathing, exercise, meditation, relationships, yoga, and massage, as well as regulated\ndaily and seasonal routines. It also uses thousands of herbs and herbal formulas.\nIn addition, Ayurveda utilizes the healing properties of metals, gemstones, colors,\nand aromas.

Most of these methods, clearly described in the ancient textbooks,\nhave been used safely and successfully for healing for thousands of years, though they\nhave been scarcely known and little appreciated in the West until very recently.

It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful\nfor students\u2019 pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.\nThe energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure\ngold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil\nuntil 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize\nthe heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won\u2019t\nhurt your gold.)\nYou can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice\npot, and cook as usual.

Silver\nincreases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation,\nchronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, in\u027bammatory conditions of the\nintestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver.

It increases\nthe production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle\nand nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and\npans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it.\nAlthough women during their menstruating years may be iron-de\u0279cient and may bene\u0279t\nfrom additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron.

Gems enliven the vital energy centers in the\nbody (the chakras) and have a direct in\u027buence on vata, pitta, and kapha. They may be\nused to pacify or activate speci\u0279c organs of the body, or to enhance or neutralize the\neffects of particular planets in the person\u2019s astrological birth chart.\nBefore we go into the e\u0283ects of speci\u0279c gems and stones, here are a few important\ngeneral points.\n\u2022 Gems tend to absorb the qualities and energy vibrations of their owners. It is\nbene\u0279cial to purify any stone before using it. Soaking it for two days in saltwater or\nmilk should be sufficient. This will not harm the stone.\n\u2022 When you wear a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the\nsetting, so that the subtle energies of the stone can interact directly with the energies of\nthe body.\n\u2022 Where you wear the stone is important. Here are some recommendations:\ndiamond\u2014ring finger\npearl\u2014little finger\nred coral\u2014ring finger\nemerald\u2014little finger\nopal\u2014ring finger\nyellow sapphire\u2014index finger\nblue sapphire\u2014middle finger\nAyurveda generally recommends that rings be worn on the right hand, though in the\nWest, if someone wants to wear their wedding ring on the left hand to conform with\ntradition, that is all right.\n\u2022 Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. It is\nbest to get authentic, unprocessed, clean stones without a \u027baw or crack. When you are\nconsidering buying a stone, be sure to use a magnifying glass to examine it for cracks or\nimperfections.\n\u2022 Stones should be 3 to 5 karats if possible, but a 1-karat diamond is large enough. A\nstone that is too small will not produce much of an effect.\n\u2022 Unless you are knowledgeable both in stones and in Vedic astrology \n(jyotish\n), it is\nwise to consult an expert before investing in a stone. The wrong gem for you, or one\nworn on the wrong part of the body, can have a negative influence.\nHere are some of the characteristics of the main gems and stones.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2161, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d203c33-d354-4edf-bfe2-f0695f42a365": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d203c33-d354-4edf-bfe2-f0695f42a365", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e57db28d-8818-4b03-a66f-21945e993929", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "2112200f6eadcf07ce58a93622a77484258998289816c1086897662cb28429ed"}}, "hash": "2112200f6eadcf07ce58a93622a77484258998289816c1086897662cb28429ed", "text": "RUBY\nAstrologically, the ruby represents the sun. It is a life-protecting stone that promotes\nlongevity, especially for vata and kapha individuals, and brings prosperity. This gem\nstrengthens concentration and bestows mental power. It also strengthens the heart.\nRubies pacify vata and kapha but may elevate pitta. Garnets have the same vibration as\nrubies; they are the poor man\u2019s ruby. Wear both rubies and garnets either in a ring on\nthe ring finger, or in a necklace.\nPEARL\nAs rubies represent the sun, pearls symbolize the moon. They have a cooling e\u0283ect\nand a calming, healing vibration. Pearls are balancing to all the doshas, though their\ncooling \naction is particularly good for pitta. Pearls confer mental peace and tranquillity.\nPearl ash is used internally to e\u0283ectively treat many ailments. You can gain many of the\nstrengthening e\u0283ects of pearls by making pearl water. Place 4 or 5 pearls in a glass of\nwater; let it stand overnight, and drink the water in the morning.\nYELLOW SAPPHIRE\nThis precious stone, which represents Jupiter, brings groundedness, stability, and\nwisdom. It helps to calm both vata and pitta and may slightly increase kapha qualities.\nIt strengthens the heart and also builds lung and kidney energy. Yellow sapphire should\nalways be worn on the index \u0279nger, the \u0279nger of Jupiter. Yellow topaz, the poor man\u2019s\nsapphire, has many of the same qualities and produces similar benefits.\nBLUE SAPPHIRE\nThis beautiful precious stone represents Saturn and brings the bene\u0279ts of that very\nspiritual planet. Saturn, a deity of earth and iron, confers enlightenment. Blue sapphire\ncalms vata and kapha and may stimulate pitta. It builds up muscles and the skeletal\nsystem and helps to heal arthritis. Wear blue sapphire on the right middle \u0279nger,\npreferably in a silver setting. Do not wear it with diamonds; this will create disharmony.\nLAPIS LAZULI\nThis stone, which has Saturn-like energy, is heavenly and sacred. It gives strength to\nthe body, mind, and consciousness, and it sensitizes the wearer to higher spiritual\nvibrations.

They are best set in gold and worn on the little finger.\nDIAMOND\nThis very powerful gemstone combats premature aging, enhances the span of life,\nand strengthens immunity. Its energy brings subtle energy vibrations to the heart, brain,\nand deeper bodily tissues. It is the best stone for rejuvenation. It brings prosperity and is\nspiritually uplifting.\nThe doshic e\u0283ects of diamonds vary according to their color. Red diamonds have a\n\u0279ery energy that stimulates pitta; blue diamonds are cooling and calm pitta while\nincreasing kapha. Clear, colorless diamonds calm pitta but increase both vata and\nkapha.\nSymbolic of the planet Venus, diamonds actually do help to create a close bond in\nrelationships and are rightfully associated \nwith marriage. These stones stimulate \nshukra\n,\nthe body\u2019s reproductive tissue. Art, music, romance, and sex all go together with this\nstone.

People working in psychological healing should wear this stone in a gold\nsetting on their ring or little finger; it will help protect them from negative influences.\nQUARTZ CRYSTALS\nThese stones have a Venus-like vibratory energy that is somewhat like that of\ndiamonds. They calm vata, improve the quality of perception, strengthen\ncommunication, and enhance intuition. You can wear quartz crystals as a necklace, or\nset in either silver or gold and worn on the ring finger.\nONYX\nThis stone is excellent for vata disorders. It is good for old age, debilitating disorders,\nand neurological dysfunction, and it helps with epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and even\nschizophrenia.

Aquamarine should be set in\nsilver and worn on the little finger.\nRemember that in all these cases, simply wearing the correct stone is not enough to\ntake care of a doshic imbalance; you need to watch your diet, meditate, do appropriate\nexercise and yoga postures, and consciously \nand conscientiously look after your day-to-\nday and moment-to-moment health.\nFour Inexpensive Stones to Help Balance the Doshas\nThough some of the gemstones discussed in this appendix can be obtained for a\nmoderate amount of money, many may be prohibitively priced for you at this time.\nIf so, here are four inexpensive stones you can use to help create balance in your\nmind and body.\nWhen vata dosha is excessive, you can use \nrose quartz\n to promote balance. The\nwarming color and energy of rose quartz can bring relief to vata ailments such as\nnervousness, dry skin, constipation, intestinal gas, and lower back pain.\nFor aggravated pitta, use \nred coral\n or \npearls\n. Their cooling energy will help with\npitta disorders such as angry emotions, various in\u027bammatory conditions and \u201c-\nitises\u201d such as colitis and conjunctivitis, as well as hyperacidity.\nKapha dosha can be balanced by wearing \ngarnets\n. The deep red color of this\nstone enlivens the energy in the body and reduces the e\u0283ects of excess kapha, such\nas water retention, lethargy, depression, and overweight.\nMore information about these and other gemstones, and how to wear them (settings,\ncorrect \u0279ngers, and so on) is provided in \nchapter 8\n of my book \nSecrets of the Pulse\n (see\nthe \nReading List\n).\nColors\nAyurvedic treatments also make use of the healing properties inherent in colors.\nBecause the basic colors of the rainbow are correlated with the bodily tissues \n(dhatus)\nand the doshas, the vibratory energy of the colors may be used to help establish balance\nin mind and body.\nColor is nothing but light, and light is radiant energy imparted from every atom.

Drinking the\nwater will then bring beneficial results.\nRED\nRed is warming and stimulating. It relieves aggravated vata and reduces excess\nkapha. However, because of its heating e\u0283ect, overexposure to this color may aggravate\npitta and result in in\u027bammatory ailments such as conjunctivitis. Red is related to our\nblood.

These \u0279ve senses are the gateways of\nperception for the human being, and they can be used for healing purposes.\nAromatherapy uses incense and essential oils made from \u027bowers, plants, trees, and\ngrasses to relay fragrances through the olfactory sense to the brain, in order to bring\nhealing energy to mind and body. Ayurveda teaches that smells are directly related to\ndoshic balance and imbalance, and that certain aromas are heating, cooling, or neutral.\nDeer musk, for example, and hina, are heating: they calm vata and kapha but may\nprovoke pitta. Camphor is cooling and fragrant, but its aftere\u0283ect is heating; it too\ncalms and paci\u0279es vata and kapha but may stimulate pitta. The aroma of sandalwood is\nanti-in\u027bammatory and cooling; it is calming and soothing for pitta but may increase\nkapha or vata.\nKhus (the essence of khus grass) is grounding, pleasant, and cooling. It has a sweet\nsmell and paci\u0279es pitta, but it may provoke kapha and vata. Jasmine too is cooling and\nsweet and good for pitta, but it may build up kapha.\nThe e\u0283ect of rose depends somewhat on the color of the \u027bower. Dark red roses are\nwarming, while white- and yellow-colored roses are relatively cooling. In general, the\naroma of rose \u027bowers is anti-in\u027bammatory and soothing and has an aphrodisiac quality.\nRose aroma can be used for cooling pitta but may provoke vata and kapha.\nAROMAS AND THE DOSHAS\n\u2022 Vata can be balanced by using sweet, warming, grounding aromas such as musk,\nhina, and camphor.

Always try to get organic, nonirradiated herbs. Special\nAyurvedic herbs and herbal formulas are available from The Ayurvedic Institute, the\nsuppliers listed in the Resources, and some Indian groceries.\nHOW TO TAKE HERBS\nHerbs are almost always taken with a vehicle or medium (\nanupana\n) to facilitate\nabsorption by the body and to carry the quality of the herbs to the speci\u0279c tissue or site\nof the disease. The most common vehicles used in Ayurveda are water, milk, honey, aloe\nvera, and ghee. Raw sugar may also be used at times. The vehicle varies according to the\nherb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors.\nTypically, you might take your herbal dose with a spoonful of ghee or honey; mixed in a\ncup of warm milk; or placed dry on your tongue and then washed down with some\nwarm or room-temperature water.\nMost of the recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is\nsuggested, use warm water. I do not recommend using capsules because taste is\nimportant (see \nthis page\n), but if you must use them, you can buy some empty 00-size\nvege-capsules (available at most natural food stores) and \u0279ll them with the herbal\nmixture. This is better than not taking the herbs at all, and may be more convenient\nwhen you are traveling or at work.\nUSING TRIPHALA\nTriphala\n (\u201cthe three fruits\u201d) is a wonderful remedy consisting of three of the most\nimportant Ayurvedic herbs: \namalaki, bibhitaki\n, and \nharitaki. Amalaki\n works on pitta dosha,\nbibhitaki\n on kapha dosha, and \nharitaki\n on vata dosha. This compound is rejuvenative and\nstrengthening for all three doshas and all seven \ndhatus;\n it balances \nojas, tejas\n, and \nprana\nand is also an excellent, mild laxative.\nTake \ntriphala\n in the evening, at least 1 hour after your evening meal. Add \u00bd to 1\nteaspoon \ntriphala\n powder to about 1 cup boiling water. Steep for 10 minutes or until the\nwater is cool enough to drink. You may strain out the herbs before drinking or just leave\nthem at the bottom of your cup.\nYou may not like the taste of \ntriphala\n at \u0279rst\u2014it may taste quite bitter. But if you use\nit regularly, your health is bound to improve, and you will eventually \u0279nd that the taste\nbecomes less unpleasant.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2431, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cb01db5-bbf0-495d-87bf-4caaf2f29548": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cb01db5-bbf0-495d-87bf-4caaf2f29548", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "311", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8313846a-a89a-4637-a925-bb2184c2412c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "311", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "6f0bbc992dedf2e56e3299e624492d7b20c07920ed6be76a79a84cc6bbdf4fab"}}, "hash": "6f0bbc992dedf2e56e3299e624492d7b20c07920ed6be76a79a84cc6bbdf4fab", "text": "Triphala\n can also be taken in these ways:\n1\n. \nPlace \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of dry \ntriphala\n powder on your tongue, and wash it down\nwith warm water.\n2\n. \nFor some people, \ntriphala\n acts as a mild diuretic and may disturb sleep if taken at\nnight.

Put the butter (sweet and\nunsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium,\nand heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn the butter.\nThen turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this\ntemperature. Do not cover the pot, as it is important to boil the water out and separate\nthe solids. The butter will foam and sputter for a while and then begin to quiet down.\nStir it occasionally with a stainless steel spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan.\nIn 12 to 15 minutes your ghee will begin to smell like popcorn and will turn a lovely\ngolden color. Whitish curds will form and separate from the clear ghee. When these\nwhitish curds turn a light tan color and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Take\nit o\u0283 the heat immediately, for it is most likely to burn at this stage. The cooking time\nshould not be longer than 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the kind of pan and the heat\nsource.\nLet the ghee cool until it is just warm. The solid curds will have settled to the bottom\nof the pot. Decant the clear ghee into a container, and discard the curds left on the\nbottom.\nSTORING GHEE\nGhee can be kept on the kitchen shelf. It does not need refrigeration. Its medicinal\nproperties are said to improve with age. Don\u2019t ladle out the ghee with a wet spoon or\nallow any water to get into the container, as this will create the conditions for bacteria\nto grow and spoil the ghee.\nEFFECTS OF GHEE", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1987, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a528cfa9-d33a-489f-b4e2-8b85103155e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a528cfa9-d33a-489f-b4e2-8b85103155e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "312", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c0f375d-a54e-440a-b725-1a1e5a2a5a11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "312", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "d808af2a95e2daa66874ecb3e73ce95aed6aafc358387aa876b8b355d3acbd05"}}, "hash": "d808af2a95e2daa66874ecb3e73ce95aed6aafc358387aa876b8b355d3acbd05", "text": "Ghee increases digestive \u0279re and improves absorption and assimilation. It nourishes\nojas\n, the subtle essence of all the body\u2019s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous\nsystem, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body\nmore \u027bexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven \ndhatus\n. It\npacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.\nNOTE\n: People who have high cholesterol or who su\u0283er from obesity should be\ncautious about using ghee.\nHOW TO MAKE MEDICATED GHEES\nGhee is a highly e\u0283ective \nanupana\n (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of\nthe body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include\nshatavari\n ghee, \nbrahmi\n ghee, \ntikta ghrita\n (bitter ghee), \ntriphala\n ghee, and many others. The\nprocess is quite lengthy, and you will probably prefer to purchase these medicated ghees\n(and medicated oils as well). But if you wish to make it yourself, proceed as follows:\nFirst, make the ghee, as described above.\nNext, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts\nof water, or about \u00bd ounce of herbs per cup (8 ounces) of water. Boil the herbs \nslowly\nover a low \u027bame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount. For\nexample, 4 cups would be reduced to 1, or 1 cup to \u00bc cup. Then strain out the herbs.\nThis process takes several hours. The liquid can be used as a prepared medicinal\ndecoction, but in this case, you are going to use it for your medicated ghee.\nFinally, mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low\nflame until all the water evaporates.\nMedicated Oils\nMedicated oils (\namla\n oil, \nbrahmi\n oil, \nbhringaraj\n oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others) are\nmade the same way, except that you use oil instead of \nghee\n in the final stage.\nNEEM OIL\nNeem\n oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking \nneem\n leaves in a base of sesame\n(usually) or some other oil. It is not pure \nneem\n extract, which would be too strong. \nNeem\noil is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.\nHow Long to Take a Remedy", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2115, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6908a50-ee0f-4067-8d37-a48f6604e0f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6908a50-ee0f-4067-8d37-a48f6604e0f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "313", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8b77de6-e420-4b37-8d06-0ede3d729dfa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "313", "file_name": "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf"}, "hash": "e86f98e71cdb46e1b42e8f99d9ff85df0747769bd892894aa40fea09dd8d0c32"}}, "hash": "e86f98e71cdb46e1b42e8f99d9ff85df0747769bd892894aa40fea09dd8d0c32", "text": "The general rule is to use remedies until your symptoms disappear.
